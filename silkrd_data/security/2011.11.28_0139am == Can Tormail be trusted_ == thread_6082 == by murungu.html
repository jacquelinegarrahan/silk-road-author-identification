				I have just created and account @tormail.net via thunderbird under cover of the tor network itself.<br /><br />The tor network and tormail are unrelated, but use the same concept to move data.<br /><br />Tormail have a very reassuring homepage, and there is no way any personal info is required when signing up.<br /><br />But still, it&#039;s new-ish, it could be an elaborate sting... can any tormail users vouch for its authenticity?<br /><br />You can mail me on my tormail addy jus to test it out... LOLZ.

				Tormail + Thunderbird + Enigmail + GPG should be pretty safe, and you can always install a portable version of Thunderbird on an encrypted USB drive or whatever. The main risk I see is in scripts that may be contained in emails and could cause Thunderbird to leak information. If you set your security settings carefully though, you should probably be fine.

				In the late 90s PGP created the OpenPGP standard, which basically makes software that implements it compatible with PGP. GPG is an open source OpenPGP implementation. So the short answer is, GPG is what you want.

				Is it odd that I can only send a message maybe one time in 20 using their RoundCube webmail interface?

				I would definitely recommend SquirrelMail&nbsp; for accessing Tormail on the web if you are concerned about your privacy. It does not use javascript, which will be blocked in a secure Tor browser anyway because of its potential to leak information.

				I have spent a lot of my spare time since I created this post looking at my comms options here on SR.<br />I found squirrelmail worked with attachments, roundcube failed.<br /><br />I still have difficulty getting a smooth interface with free GPG4WIN with multiple cut n paste to the point where I&#039;m losing track of the message process if someone interrupts me for a minute, not good! (This is because tormail has no way to openly interface with GPG4WIN so everything (messages and keys) have to be copied and pasted into Kleopatra for encyrption, then pasted into notepad and then into tormail, far out :(<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try arcticsoft PGP for a few days, if its easier, I&#039;ll pay $90 for it. Time is money!<br />However I have a hunch that tormail being a &#039;ghost&#039; service will again be the issue.<br /><br />Thinking about encryption, the only thing that I can see needs it are delivery addresses, surely ordering shit via tormail and SR should be security enough? <br /><br />Let&#039;s face it, LE could harvest a LOT of info here just tracking these BB conversations, people slip up, boast, and also likely post drunk and or high here.<br /><br />Not only that, but most if not all the discussions here focus on circumventing laws, offering or sourcing contraband which themselves (the discussions) are illegal in many jurisdictions! <br /><br />So all the huffing and puffing about encrypting your actual drug bartering on an untraceable browser in a diffused &#039;cloud&#039; site with an untraceable dealer is absurd IMO! <br /><br />Same with tumbling bitcoin into multiple wallets. Bit coin is &#039;clean&#039; its not illegal to trade it (yet) and your SR wallet is encrypted till the end of time. <br /><br />I think if it makes ppl feel better, OK, but the overkill -given the systems already in place- is it really necessary?<br />All the software I&#039;m evaluating on my system (to secretly order a pill or powder) is suspect in itself, it surely defeats the purpose of SR!&nbsp; Anyone care to rebut this thinking?&nbsp; &nbsp;(Be kind if you do!)<br /><br />

				Seems to me the ultimate security measure would be to regularly sweep your system for trojan keyloggers. If someone has got into your system, all the wallets, tumblers, tors, and PGP toys in the world ain&#039;t worth shit.<br /><br />A final thought, I operate Mac and PC, any mac users care to comment on their encryption tools?

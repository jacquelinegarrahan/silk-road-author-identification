				&nbsp;Hi everyone hws it? im new here and the more i read the more im getting confused!&nbsp; :-[ lol, i see things like pgp codes or whatever getting thrown around and you might aswell be speaking arabic! I have a few questions but i will tell you a bit about what i have so far and how i got here... my weed dealer moved so i had to find another way of getting so after searching the net over and over i noticed &#039;&#039;silk road&#039;&#039; mentioned a few times, did a search found a site with a link and clicked it and it didn&#039;t let me use it, tried to find out why and found out about Tor, so i have downloaded Tor and then copy/pasted link and got into silk road that way. <br /><br />When i first got onto this site my eyes lit up ounces of weed for $13! I thought no F*cking way if it is only $13 it will be like £11!!!(from uk) I got really excited then i noticed the sign wasn&#039;t a dollar sign and yet again had to do a bit more research found out they were bitcoins and then when i seen the exchange rates it was back to reality. Anyway i got a wallet and i got paid today so i have been trying to figure out how to add funds to it so here is what i have : TOR BROWSER... WALLET... ACCOUNT HERE, and thats it lol, what i need to know is how to i add f*cking bitcoins to my wallet? Every site ive seen is extremely complicated and i don&#039;t want to take the risk so what sites do people here recommend?<br /><br />What else do i need if i do need more than what i have and how do i get them? Just after being on the forum im paranoid i haven&#039;t got all the tools i need even once my wallet is topped up. <br /><br />Once that has been sorted i&#039;m from the UK so i am just wondering what is people&#039;s recommendations on UK vendors here best price/speed of delivery? <br /><br />Lastly i hope i spell this right but what is &#039;escrow&#039;? I have seen that floating around aswell and seems an important part of buying. <br /><br />I&#039;m not the sharpest tool in the box when it comes to all this so any dumbed down guide to these questions would be much appreciated because i love the fact i can get my weed but untill i know how its of no use to me&nbsp; :( lol thanks.

				You can transform your paycheck money into bitcoins at ecurrency exchanges.<br />I or you can dig up a thread explaining exchanges...it might even be in the SR wiki, cant remember at the moment.<br />Sorry I cant grab the info at this very second but I&#039;m physically pushed about to my edge at the moment.<br />Also try researching the vendors on SR that exchange money for BTC. Please be smart about your choice if you go that route. Key things to look for are how long have they been an exchanger, rep # and feedback for them in the forum in the Rumor Mill section. Obviously a vendor here over a year with high rep # is gonna be safer than an exchanger that became a vendor 2 weeks ago.<br /><br />If others in the community dont mind helping please fill in the gaps I&#039;ve skipped I need to get some rest and nourishment. I&#039;ll check this thread in 5-6 hours and recap.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad<br />:)<br />nomad

				a lot to learn. ALL your answers are either here on the forum, or on the SR site itself. If you had spent the time you used writing your post and instead searched around you would have a lot less...if any questions.<br /><br /><br />Its all here.<br />

				I realise that but i just don&#039;t know where to begin tbh, i guess the main question i have is once iv&#039;e figured out how to buy bitcoins online can i just go onto silkroad find the weed i want click to buy it and that is it? (obviously check the vendors reviews etc first)

				BTC is purchased in many ways depending on the country you are in.&nbsp; First tip, I know you want your product now but that is not&nbsp; the proper way to proceed this is not a drive thru web site. SR members that I have had the pleasure of learning from will tell you t learn..... then order, most just want to learn how to order and not the proper procedure.&nbsp; <br /><br />Suggestion.....Read the stickies take it slow. search &quot;best way to buy bitcoins in_________&quot;<br /><br />Learn and purchase BITCOINS<br /><br />review and select product...read all he vendors terms on there profile page<br /><br />before purchasing recommended to have learnt PGP for sending your address to vendor.<br /><br />by now the Bitcoins should of managed to make it thru the final stages so you can purchase<br /><br />Purchase&nbsp; sit back learn some more while you wait for your product . <br /><br />hope this helps you some<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Once you have managed to buy your bitcoins and sent them to silkroad the only problem is trying to choose your vendor!<br /><br />For weed im going to recommend the best UK vendor&#039;s I have brought from in the last few months in no particular order. Please don&#039;t take this as a concisive list as im sure there&#039;s lots of vendors I haven&#039;t tried that are awesome! or maybe just forgot...!<br />SweetLeafLondon, NoStickNoSeeds, AustinAwayway, Uksales, GreenGiant &amp; UK107.<br /><br />At least for me these are the go-to guys when I want green UK domestic but before you place any order take a look around the rumor mill part of the forum for reviews on specific vendors and be careful.... especially for your first orders.<br /><br />Good luck on the road bro :)

				Hi, welcome to the Silk Road!<br /><br />First things first: try to exercise patience. Sit around and try to read up on as much as possible before jumping into the process of ordering drugs.<br />This sticky will get you started on things:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br />Liberte, as mentioned in the sticky thread, is something I can&#039;t recommend highly enough. Increased security for little effort and negligible to no cost. I only access Tor from my computer when running Liberte, so as to prevent any evidence whatsoever that I have been accessing SR.<br /><br />Another crucial thing is to learn PGP. Join the PGP club, etc whatever it takes. The users Pine and LouisCyphre are very helpful in this respect, but there are many others who would be glad to help you set up and learn PGP (Liberte comes with gpa already installed, btw). Use PGP for sending information such as your address, or anything you want to remain between you and the recipient.<br /><br />Third: we&#039;re here for you. I&#039;m glad you thought to come here first and ask around before blindly buying without knowing all the facts, potentially jeopardizing your security.<br />Remember that it is within our best interests to give you all the information you need to be successful, because if you get arrested and it&#039;s connected to SR, it brings unwanted attention towards the site, which no one wants. So if you don&#039;t understand something, never be afraid to ask.<br /><br />If you have any specific questions that I may be able to answer (or refer you to a thread that will answer better than I could) please feel free to message me.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Simply using these forums makes you effectively smarter than many people shopping on Silk Road. There is a teensy bit of a learning curve; but, if you can use TOR and find your way here? You can absolutely convert some £ to ฿, learn PGP, and get a happy package shipped right to your door!<br /><br />Just remember, the escrow system is in place to protect both buyer and seller. Stay away from sellers that require any and all business to be FE&#039;d ( finalized early). <br /><br />As a new buyer even legit sellers might want you to FE. You can do so safely. Stick with a seller that has a good reputation, send them a &quot;Hi, I am a n00b!&quot; introductory PM before placing an order. Buy the smallest of amounts. No different than buying only a gram or two the first time with a new face to face supplier. Once you have a few sales under your belt and a good reputation you can move up to a larger amount.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Sure, take advice from people, but always do your own research on the advice you receive. It may seem a tad overwhelming at first, but all the information you need for a successful Silk Road purchase is contained here in the various forums.<br />Read the Silk Road Buyer&#039;s Guide if you haven&#039;t done so already, or even if you have, read over it again: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide

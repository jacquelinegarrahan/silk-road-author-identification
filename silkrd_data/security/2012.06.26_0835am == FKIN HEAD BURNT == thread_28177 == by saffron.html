				Whilst I agree with your sentiment Limetless OP did not ask a specific question that he needed help with. His queries could all be answered by reading the security threads and especially the sticky posts.<br /><br />When a vendor is responsible for buyer safety then it is nice to know they are happy to spend a little time and effort getting set up.<br /><br />You dont need to know everything and be an über-hacker, you just need to know how it works in case anything goes wrong. No good having a friend set it all up then not be able to fulfill orders because you forgot how PGP works and your friend is sunning himself on the Costa del Sol for a fortnight.

You just have to be willing to learn. I suggest you also wander round the threads a bit as well because there is loads of info and tutorials on how to do the basics. Doesn&#039;t take long for it to sink in. :)

And yeah but to be fair when I do new stuff with IT quite a lot of the time I need to be walked through it and reading the stuff on the forum don&#039;t always sink in. Different people are good at different things and learn those things in different ways. Not everyone can be fully IT literate in the same way not everyone can be good at Money Laundering or Vending or Carding or Social Engineering or whatever the fuck ever. These differences aren&#039;t a reason to belittle people especially as they clearly want to make the effort. Bit of courtesy and respect goes a long way.&nbsp;

I suppose the joke is on me as people do get away with selling drugs without encryption etc quite frequently, but I think that says more about the feds lack of skill&nbsp; than it does the skill of the people not using such techniques. <br /><br />I would have been much more polite by ignoring this thing that I saw as humorous and perhaps asking him exactly what he wants assistance with?<br /><br />Also, I used inherent when I should have used apparent .

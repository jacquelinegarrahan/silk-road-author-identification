				sometimes i see guys getting virtual hardons over avatars or female persona&#039;s on the forums and i can just imagine a guys groin giving themselves away.<br /><br />females seem to have such a special place on the internet and i think allot of their rise to fame comes from their avatars or the fact they appear to be female. add in several hundred men that thinks a female is giving good information is also hot and the presence of time and you end up with a persona that seems trustworthy<br /><br />i would suspect LEO would be primarily using female personas to get into the pants of males on the website. i think thats the easiest way to socially hack men on the internet<br /><br />just sayin&#039;!<br /><br /><br />

				Well, just look how popular pine&#039;s &quot;naked photos&quot; thread was (and still is). I don&#039;t know who the person in her avatar is, but if that&#039;s &quot;her&quot;, I wouldn&#039;t mind combining my 9216 bit ElGamal with her private key either. I never met an attractive woman that not only uses PGP, but understands it as well. Most can&#039;t even spell &quot;PGP&quot; let alone discuss public key crypto.<br /><br />OK, seriously though, in all likelihood you&#039;re never going to meet any of the &quot;girls&quot; you talk to on SR. You shouldn&#039;t be bragging or giving away personal details anyway, but one has to be especially careful when dealing with the ideal trojan horse. There are plenty of users on here that aren&#039;t nerdy teenage prudes or basement dwelling adult losers, and as such will not jump at every single female SR member like this was some juvenile anime forum. However, a smart, attractive woman that does the same shit as you is pretty fucking hot, and LE knows this. Please be careful.

Especially for an anonymous drug network where sex is irrelevant and protecting your identity is the top priority. Flipping your gender and typing as a girl is definitely a benefit for masking your identity.

				for all those who believes everything on the web, especially what a guy or girl looks like or likes doing etc..... deserves everything that comes their way.&nbsp; the web is one dimension.&nbsp; <br /><br />like Pine said, actions, not appearances.<br /><br />I don&#039;t give a rats ass who or what you look like, or do, how many posts you have, or what you write. i take it all with a grain of salt or LSD... :-*

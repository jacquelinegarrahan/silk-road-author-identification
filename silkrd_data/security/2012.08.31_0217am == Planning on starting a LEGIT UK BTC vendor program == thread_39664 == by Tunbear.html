				A lot of us got burned by vladamir. Now that his details are out there I can&#039;t even go check if the address is public because one or a few of you fucktards have either threatened to or have actually done it - passed his information onto PE...so while those of you who are not arsed because you only received coins in a wallet I&#039;ve been having to scrub bank accounts I had him paying into, so fuck whoever did that in the arse with a dick made of shit..<br /><br />That aside, I&#039;m planning on starting a UK only coin exchange. There will be no commission, only going rates - you will either buy coins off me or sell coins to me, all cash, only cash coming to me going to dummy drops i&#039;m in the process of setting up.<br /><br />If there&#039;s an interest (as stated, UK only, not going cross borders for this, it isn&#039;t for me to make money it&#039;s to create a mini economy where I can get rid of my coins for cash and help others do the same) - the only way I&#039;d make a profit in this, is by implementing a lower rate on a few transactions when my load becomes too high (giggidy) so I at least don&#039;t get caught paying out my own cash to run it.<br /><br />Anyone interested lemme know in this thread and I;ll proceed setting this up.<br /><br />They&#039;ll be no schemes, no investments, on put 12p in you&#039;ll get a winning euromillions ticket sent to you...it&#039;ll be a cash business with few to no fees, just cutting out the middle man<br /><br />Intersango is dead UK wise, you can withdraw via EU wire transfer but it takes up to 2 weeks, post willing we could do business in &lt;18h<br /><br />Floating like a turd that won&#039;t flush, so just put your hand up if you&#039;re interested.

				I would be interested! I think I was one of the last people to use Vlad and not get stung by his Houdini act!<br /><br />I have used MT GOX historically but I keep hearing they are going to stop cash deposits, essentially the reason they gave me was that they are having to pay for cash deposits so want to restrict it to just online transfers. <br /><br />Anyone know anymore about this as currently i need to get some BTC and not sure if I trust MT GOX to put the cash deposit into account.

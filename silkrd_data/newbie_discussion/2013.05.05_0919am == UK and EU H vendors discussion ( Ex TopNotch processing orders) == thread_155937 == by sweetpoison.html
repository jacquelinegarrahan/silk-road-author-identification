				I&#039;ve read yesterday on the forum that people&#039;s orders from TopNoth are still processing since thursday so does mine, i&#039;ve never ever had problems with this vendor before, so i&#039;m presuming smth is wrong with the site? Who else has the same problem? and what shall we do? Also wanted to ask: as far as I know we can cancel our order in 4 days if it was not marked - in transit, but do we have all bitcoins (money) back, or SK takes it&#039;s charge?

				I had a similar issue with theDankBank, he sent me a pm today to let me know he&#039;d be shipping on Monday.&nbsp; I think it is just because of all the craziness this past week. Think about it, bit coin crash, the ddos fucker attacking the road and tormail was down. Buyers were still getting on and making orders intermittently, I think the vendors were just overwhelmed with not having access to the road. Give him a few extra days before you cancel, he may send you something extra or heavy. Did you send him a pm?&nbsp;

				If a vendor says &quot; I don&#039;t have time for messages or is rude, then why in the hell are they even here?.. Come on its like any business...&nbsp; the customer comes first, Next time a vendor tells you that, please tell them you will take your money elsewhere. Cocky Grouchy vendors suck, :)<br />My 2 cents worth.. ;)

				he is not rude and always answers the messages, but&nbsp; he says on his profile page- no need to send messages to confirm your orders because i send every order. + he is N1 UK H vendor. <br />Is anyone else having their order pending with this vendor?

				Hey sweetpoison,<br /><br />I have had an order pending since Wednesday 11am. I did send a message Friday hoping to get my stuff Saturday but no joy. Didn&#039;t really want to as his inbox must be stuffed.<br /><br />I can only assume TopNotch has been swamped and hasn&#039;t had the online time to sort it out.<br /><br />I hope the guy is ok, it seems he managed to log on yesterday so hopefully if SR stays up he can sort our orders out. It doesn&#039;t help that it&#039;s a bank holiday Monday tomorrow.<br /><br />I noticed that the offer to cancel is in 4 days, so my BTC are held in escrow until then.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update this thread if I hear anything or my delivery turns up.<br /><br />Sucks to be hanging out for gear eh?!&nbsp; :P ::)

				Hey, I started a similar thread yesterday. I know how you feel. It&#039;s frustrating, but it will get sorted out. TN seems very reliable to me, I sent him an email however, and that didn&#039;t get a reply. It&#039;s the bloody DoS. I always seem very unlucky with all of it. I took a loan out on wednesday because I was only getting my money on saturday. I wanted to order wednesday to be sorted for the bank holiday weekend, then, this happened again. What a ball ache. I also paid £10 over the odds for BTC to get them instantly. Patience is a virtue, eh?

				I was one buyer who posted a thread about TN just because it was my 1st order and wanted to know if others were in the same boat or had I fkd something up?<br />It now seems like he must be bogged down trying to get orders out because of the attacks but the guy has been online every day since my order so Im a bit confused.<br />Its some consolation that others are having trouble too so I know its not something I&#039;ve done but still!<br />Ive been on all week hoping that my &#039;processing&#039; had turned to &#039;shipped&#039;or whatever it says but nothing and ive got 4 more days until i can cancel.Thing is,I dont want to cancel,I want my bag ffs!<br />can just hope things are back to normal after Monday but whoever heard of a dealer that takes bank holidays off?<br />hope its worth it when it does finally arrive.

				One thing is that TopNotch is very accurate&nbsp; vendor and sorts everything about quite fast, mostly it&#039;s 24 hour delivery, and i myself also wanted to be sorted for weekend, but the other thing is that DarkTime is wright- TN was online every day since yesterday, I was expecting&nbsp; him at least to post smth on his profile page about being or not being able to do orders and stuff like that<br />P.S. Keep your posts updated, peeps,- how your orders are doing :)

Not always by much but it is always cleaner though.<br /><br />The thing is you can get #4 H on the SR and I have only seen #4 once IRL and that was a long time ago. Whatever floats your boat I guess.

				yes, I got Wednesdays order this morning and Fridays is still processing. I have never had issues with tn so best just to hang on in there. I think he is backed up and has taken the listings down to give him self time to catch up on back orders. Anyhow if his listings stay down do you know another #4 vendor who is safe to use

				I have 2 orders that I placed a few days ago and are still processing - my issue is that he has no active listings now for people to order. I&#039;m just hoping he&#039;s not out of stock and those of us that haven&#039;t been marked in transit missed the boat with this batch.<br /><br />Or maybe he&#039;s just disabled all listings until he gets up to speed with the orders people have placed?<br /><br />Not sure whether to worry or not, as I want his H and only his H, as he is without doubt the best UK H vendor on SR.

				2&nbsp; horsetank - smb here on the thread said their wed order was marked in transit- may be they ordered in the morning and you say you ordered late night&gt; I ordered thursday and mine is still processing,- so i&#039;m presuming he is doing orders in turn,- so next one is yours and mine, i hope :)<br />&nbsp;i don&#039;t think you should keep ordering H from different vendors, though i understand your impatiemce,- we all need it right now :) Your TN order will be processed soon&nbsp; and other vendor&#039;s one i hope as well ( though i never dealt with him). <br />Japan1980 is right, i myself want only TN strong H, noone else&#039;s, hence to big tolerance, thanks to subutex treatment :)<br />I hope listing are down just because he&#039;s got to manage all pending orders 1st

				2 NoAddedSugar,- how do you know that your message has not been read?<br /><br />What I can&#039;t understand is how come- some people placed their orders later last week (friday) and already got them, others placed several orders and some of them been marked transit or arrived and some are still processing and some customers orders are processing the whole week! And not a single word on the TN&#039;s page about what&#039;s going on! You are right, Japan1980! this ist H! People need to know whether they are going to get their stuff or not!

				I just dug into my emergency BTC wallet managed to get some BTC&#039;s transferred to SR within an hour and made an order with Beston3. Even if the quality isn&#039;t as good, the prices seem good and the feedback also seems very good. <br /><br />For me TN has mugged us all off by not letting us know what&#039;s going on, I have confidence that TN&#039;s orders will be sent - but for me that&#039;s beside the point. We&#039;re dealing with Heroin here not Hash, the minimum he could have done is put an UPDATE on his profile: it takes 2 minutes FFS.<br /><br />He&#039;s not even reading, let alone replying to his PM&#039;s even though he&#039;s been on line for the last 2 days - for me that is horrendous customer service. I have 2 days till I can cancel, if it&#039;s in transit by then I&#039;ll take it, If not I&#039;m cancelling without doubt.<br /><br />I&#039;ll only return as a customer if he offers a justifiable reason for this scenario - if it&#039;s simply &quot;Sorry guys I was bogged down with orders&quot; that wont cut it, as like I said it takes 2 minutes to update a vendor page.<br /><br /><br />RANT over&nbsp; 8)

				I think if I have to cancel after waiting over a week, with no comms whatsoever, that the 4% should come out of the vendors end. Should I wait indefinitely? What if was 2 months later? For ordering in good faith from a &quot;trusted&quot; vendor, and him not holding up his part of the bargain cost me money if I haven&#039;t released Esgrow? No! Of course not. I&#039;m already paying the commission on every purchase, my vendor is obviously setting the price to reflect the 6% commission

				Hey ShiftingSands, I got my crack from Dispater, I don&#039;t buy coke because I&#039;m one of those pricks who IV&#039;s his crack, and even though coke dissolves nice in just water, if it&#039;s good, it takes more to get the same high as crack, therefor costing more. And I&#039;m unemployed at the moment- a fact that has already cause me some ribbing when I mentioned it before. Like, just because I&#039;m out of work, I&#039;m not allowed to enjoy myself. Not that it matters, but I am looking. There&#039;s a shortage of domestic good crack it seems. Dispater&#039;s is alright, it doesn&#039;t blow your socks off, and considering it&#039;s been about 6 months or maybe longer since I last bought crack, it should have felt strong. I tried crystal meth from crystalmethod, but he seems to be on hols or stealth. That was good the first order, crap the second. I&#039;ve only ever ordered domestic before, I have no idea what our customs are like

				No, that&#039;s fine matrix, it&#039;s a stimulant very similar to crack when crack is IV&#039;d, it makes you very focused, it&#039;s really clear headed. If I was at school/college or something it would be a fantastic study aid! There&#039;s the same rush you get with crack/coke, but doing brown at the same time or shortly after is like, turning up the volume on the meth to 11. You get this light headedness similar to going unconscious, if you know what that&#039;s like. I would say, it makes you feel clear and focused, and a bit determined on it&#039;s own. I much prefer crack though.

				I&#039;ve just thought - wouldn&#039;t that be easier to make H ourselves? You can buy raw opium and anhydrid on SR , it&#039;ll only take 20-30 min or less to make a reaction and get H out of it!<br />What do you think, peeps?

If you can afford to throw out $10-20 you can get your 10 transactions. Make sure you pick a good vendor though so you&#039;re not left waiting for your digital goods as your transactions to increase!<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to download or open the files if you are worried about malware/viruses.

				You&#039;re very welcome poison. And to charas, I&#039;ve never washed up myself, but If started with 1g of coke, and washed it, dissolved it up and injected it, wouldn&#039;t that give me the same result as just dissolving the original 1g of coke? I&#039;m not adding any more drug to it. It&#039;s just a reduction isn&#039;t it, that makes it easier to smoke?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				NoAddedSugar.&nbsp; When you wash Coke into Crack (freebase) you are turning the coke from a Salt back to a base, A salt is water soluble and the Base is not its turned into a salt to make it able to be snorted or IVed. Crack as you will know needs vitC or Citric acid to break it down, making it dissolve in the water. which is basically turning it back to a water soluble salt. Another point is that a Salt cannot be smoked as its vape temp is too high while the base vapes at a lower temp and can be smoked.<br />&nbsp;It is the same as the difference between heroin no3 (smoking Heroin) and no4 (snorting, IV) no3 being the Base and no4 being the salt.<br />&nbsp;You can wash H No4 back to No3 with Bicarb the same as making crack from Coke, and add citric/vitC to no3H to be able to IV it. Its all to do with the PH of the Coke/Gear.<br />&nbsp; I hope this makes a little sense, it took me a long time to get my head around.<br />&nbsp;Try washing a bit of Coke it really is very easy , and very difficult to fuck up.<br />&nbsp;In answer to the question, they should be the same but IMO I think the hit from the crack when IVed is better than a coke hit and that even when they originate from the same batch of Coke. IMO Crack gives a much better high than Coke, saying that I like working on Coke and I can&#039;t say that about Crack.<br />C

It shows that mutualism works better than imagined. Also it is odd to build a rapport with hard drug dealers. It is odd to see how much of that vile propaganda about evil drug users that we end up internalising.

				Nicely put AgentLee, I also haven&#039;t used the forums before until this recent mess. My TopNotch order arrived this morning, I was so happy! It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve bought the Afghan #3 from TN, I usually buy the street gear, as I had about a year break from using H and knew I didn&#039;t need amazing stuff. Today I used roughly about 0.1 in one hit. When dissolving the brown I noticed quite a lot was just floating around, so I added more citric. Still floaty stuff going on.&nbsp; ??? . I didn&#039;t want to over do it with the acid, I&#039;m quite low on good sites I can use and would prefer it if I had a few veins left to transport the red red groovy around. Anyway, I left the lumps alone and drew up what had been dissolved, injected, then I think I nearly passed out! Good god, it&#039;s strong stuff. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn&#039;t tried it. Do any of you lovely folk know about MindGuru&#039;s Pakistani #4? I might give that a go sometime. Oh, when I last messaged TopNotch before I got my reply and had my order posted, I wrote &quot;I don&#039;t want to cancel&quot; in the subject box of the message. I recommend that to anyone who&#039;s messages are falling on deaf ears. We should definitely keep this or a related thread going. I would like to stay in touch with you dudes. Peace x

				Hey all, can someone clear up something for this n00b, What does IRL stand for? I get what it means, scoring in your home location, yeah? Like, on the street? And to Japan, how does best on 3&#039;s stuff compare then? Is it as strong as TN&#039;s street quality stuff? (street quality, not quality street) Or like the Afghan? when SR was down I went to Atlantis to order from Uglydoll. I ordered on the Thursday of last week, been messaging him to ship my shit, still &quot;yet to be shipped&quot; and no word from the vendor! argh! How can this happen again? ell, He just messaged me, saying he&#039;s going to ship it on Monday. Monday! What a twat. I could walk to Holland before Monday! And he was so matter of fact, no apology. I know for certain I&#039;m not going back to him, cheap gear or not. I messaged him both on here, and ATL, and it was on here he replied. God, you don&#039;t get this shit on Amazon! Hehehe

Yes, lets keep this tread going, so we can discuss our H and vendors and other things about SR service.<br />I got my H today, happy with the quality again.<br />2 ShiftingSands - about how to make your own H,- you buy opium and acetic anhydride ( i think there is only one vendor on SR who does it, i think he is from Polland, but i never bought from him). Disolve opium in some water in aluminum coated pan and evaporate it, so you get like a pancake at the bottom of your pan then spray it using syringe with anhydride, i&#039;d say 0.5-1 ml of it, cover the pan with cling film, put onto small gas , you will get acetilation reaction going, leave it for some time, remove cling film, evaporate till dry, then i&#039;d put some water into it, so all stuff at the bottom of your pan disolved and evaporate again, then put water again,-&nbsp; decide yourself how much water, depending on your dosage,- 1 ml is one dose, suck the quantity into syringe, using filter (better cotton wool tightly on the needle of the syringe) - and off you go, IV :) smth like that, someone to correct me or add details?<br />P.S. TN&#039;s listings are still down which is sad, in his message he said - today or tomorrow, so hopefully tomorrow now :)

				IRL=IN REAL LIFE<br /><br />sorry to hear that japan.its wierd how some got and some didnt.<br />Im getting some shithot stuff from the street at the mo.only 0.1 bags for £10 but 2 of those in a 1ml and im out before I can get the cap back on and I havnt been like that for about 10 years.the cheapo one from TN was about a 6.5/10 in my book.I might try his better one when things are all good but its #4 for me next.I&#039;ll let you all know right here on this junky thread we have created.Thing is,with this stuff im getting at the mo,I cant see me ordering from here for a while if I can just nip down the road and get 9/10 knockout kit.would you?no,would you fuck.Ive heard its coming from brum and its about £1600 an oz,which is 2x as much as normal but if you pay 800 these days,your gonna get shite.thing is,where im from,the dealers are only interested in $$$ so they buy the cheapest.WTF is the matter with them?surely they should realise that quality beats quantity anyday.they will make the same if they bought the better one because you just make the bags 0.1 instead of 0.2 or 0.3. or even just sell 0.2 for £20.Only 3 dealers in my city reconise this fact.

				I&#039;ve decided to try Dispater&#039;s dark for the first time. He&#039;s been fast with the crack deliveries, but ordered late on Saturday, so probably be Tuesday when it arrives. I do hope to see TopNotch&#039;s listings again though, the UK domestic scene is virtually none existant

				What a tremendous relief it is to see that TopNotch has returned. I shall be ordering a gram from him as soon as my coins drop on to SR.<br /><br />I have bought a gram of the regular 3 from Beston3 - whose delivery service is frankly incredible&nbsp; - but the product was relatively weak and I have torn through it like nobody&#039;s business.<br /><br />On a side note I have discovered a way to buy BTC with a credit card - I paid $15 per coin over the going rate mind - but it does work.<br /><br />It was buybitcoins.com if anyone cares. There is no review of this lot anywhere and I am suprised that it turned out to be entirely legitimate. The fellow even phoned me up since I was foolish enough to register under a nickname - and he was concerned that this did not match my credit card and ID.<br /><br />I did a writeup in the &#039;security&#039; section of this forum. Briefly the only downer is that you have to identify yourself (passport, phone number). Upside is it&#039;s fairly cheap, very quick and you can buy from anywhere in the world provided you have a credit card.<br /><br />

Given my experience of TopNotch I would offer - by way of baseless speculation - that perhaps he is being scammed. Are the buyers new? Do they return? I do not like making unevidenced claims - yet read on and see why I personally consider it very unlikely that TopNotch is responsible for these perceived problems.<br /><br />I have never had any trouble from TopNotch. In fact, I once bought some #3 from him which was poor quality. I messaged him politely saying that his dope did not work (it didn&#039;t, sadly) and expected to be ignored.<br /><br />To my amazement he replied promptly with an apology whose sincerity was underlined by the arrival the next morning of a replacement gram at no extra cost. In my long, uh, &#039;career&#039; I have never known the like.<br /><br />Besides this I have only bought his Afghan no. 3 and that has been consistently excellent - better even than the dope I bought from c63amg and Frank Matthews. I think his product is justifiably more expensive as it is consistently better. In every case my order has arrived the next day, so his delivery is in my experience 100% reliable. His business is built on high grade drugs sold at a premium price and I cannot therefore see the benefit to him in selectively scamming a customer base whose loyalty he has earned through outstanding service.<br /><br />I hope this helps, coming from one who has bought from him since he first appeared here.

I haven&#039;t heard of any shenanigans with Beston3. Ordered once - the normal #3 - it was very weak but the delivery was lightning fast. Almost as if he was lurking in my wheelie bin waiting for me to buy a bag. Beston3 responded very quickly to my messages and frankly I can&#039;t fault his delivery. I do hope his better quality dope lives up to the glowing feedback.<br /><br />I have one gram on order from TopNotch (the strong Afghan) which should be here tomorrow. Also have just ordered a gram from Beston3 - tomorrow perhaps? No sign from UglyDoll yet, Ordered 2 x 0.2 last Thurs and was told they will be sent today. No change yet. I will let you all know how it goes.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d stay away from uglydoll. When SR was down I headed over to ATL, he was on every day, I ordered 2x 0.2 from him and it was over a week with no contact, so I got their admin to cancel the order. Waste of time. My 0.3 from dispater should arrive tomorrow. I think I&#039;m going to try c63amg next, seeing as Frank Matthews requires FE.

Well I have a mixed tale - a tale of opiophiliac bliss and personal fuckwittery.<br /><br />On the latter note I ordered from UglyDoll last week. I had a little bit of loot left and the two 0.2 bags seemed attractive. I was messaged to say it would be sent out Monday. Well Monday comes and -almost- goes and not a sausage. Until, that is, my order is cancelled. UglyDoll messaged me and informed me that I had put the wrong postage option on my order. In short, I am a lettuce. So naturally a review of the product will have to wait until I can read.<br /><br />Regarding the bliss - well - I simply take my hat off to this Beston3 fellow. His &#039;no joke&#039; superior heroin is very, very good. I recieved it today. The weight is slightly over, the packaging very good, his communication prompt and informative.<br /><br />Delivery is very quick. This man is a professional. I recommend his service without hesitation as it is excellent in every regard.<br /><br />I have ordered frequently from TopNotch and would be very surprised if his orders failed to show. I am sure they will - in time - and I have one outstanding myself. <br /><br />In the meantime I suggest you order from Beston3. I would not bother with the cheaper heroin. Whilst a gram of the strong Afghan will last me around ten days, this cheaper stuff went in three. <br /><br />I do hope everyone&#039;s King Lear arrives tomorrow. Especially you, UKdabbler. Sorry to hear about your job. Good luck friend.

				I used to do a lot of acid and mushrooms, when mushrooms were legal in UK and I could buy them from Manchester or Leeds festival, I bought some of that 25i-NBOMe last week to try it out and was quite disappointed. From my experience, LSD doesn&#039;t interact with Opiates, not like Cannabis. But I&#039;ve never got on with weed, it affects me more than any other drug, well, besides Ketamine. I like Ketamine though. Sometimes...

				Hi peeps, my order from TN is still processing either and he wasn&#039;t online for&nbsp; 2 days, which means that he hasn&#039;t been online since he put his listings back, so i don&#039;t think he saw our orders yet,- i was kind of ready for that and ordered from dispater yesterday- it&#039;s still processing for now, but it&#039;s only 11.30 so hi might send it today, im going to hope that.<br />2 shifting sands about LSD - i don&#039;t know about h+ LSD mix - never tried, but heared people saying that subutex kind of dulls lucy. I&#039;m on subutex treatment, but i have take home doses, so i don&#039;t take it when i use smth else. I used to eat 1/3 of a blotter, 15 years ago though, now i need 3. I ordered some from JOR yesterday and it&#039;s already marked in transit<br />2 AgentLee - you say that you impressed with BO3&#039;s afgan one - it&#039;s smth like 3 and a bit BTC but he doesn&#039;t say how many gramms? I think i&#039;m going to try him again if no luck with TN. But it&#039;s a bit pricy - 363$ when&nbsp; you can&#039;t be sure it&#039;s going to make your door. I ince ordered 1 grm from him and it didn&#039;t arrive,- i FE though being brand new, haven&#039;t tried him afterwards.

That&#039;s not good news peeps- that your dispater&#039;s orders haven&#039;t turned up today, cuz im hoping for mine for tomorrow<br />I&#039;ve got a noob question<br />TN&#039;s orders and other orders i had before show as $ being in escrow<br />but my esterdays ones - jor and dispater show as BTC being in secrow<br />Why is that?

				Hey poison, I believe it&#039;s because one of them aren&#039;t hedged. Have you looked up about hedging? If they&#039;re hedged, they&#039;re held in dollars, so if it&#039;s cancelled or whatever, you&#039;ll get the same dollar value back, but if they&#039;re unhedged, it&#039;s held in BTC, so you get the exact same BTC back, even if the value has changed. Hope that helped

I ince ordered 1 grm from him and it didn&#039;t arrive,- i FE though being brand new, haven&#039;t tried him afterwards.

It was 3.5 grams for 3 and a bit BTC, expensive but worth it in my opinion. I now see he has changed the way it&#039;s listed and removed the actual weight. That would concern me slightly. He could give you anything and there would be no comeback. Also I did not fe so there was no problem with mine. I would pm him and get him to add the weight before you order. Maybe it&#039;s a mistake

				I believe that&#039;s right SP. It helps us too though, because of how volatile the BTC price has been, if it&#039;s hedged, we technically won&#039;t lose out. We may get less coins back, but if we&#039;re just using them on here, they&#039;ll still be as valuable, as prices are pegged to the weighted average at Mt.gox.<br />Pakchoi23, porned everything sounds kinky

				Ok just checked bo3&#039;s afghan listing and it has changed slightly. There is no weight listed and it says all orders fe with this listing. Now although he came good on my last order and I was impressed with the quality I am not prepared to spend 3.5 btc and the have to FE. There is to much to lose. thats a fair amount of dosh. I don&#039;t know why he has changed it but if you look at some of the feedback there are a few that did fe and did not receive. I can not take that risk . I will ask him to add the weight to the listing and remove fe before i order and hopefully everyone else will to. If we all sing together an all that!!

				Effing porn shop sold my laptop last week coz I was four days late. They had it for over 6 months and every month I paid off the interest along with the interest on my flat screen and my play station. Every month for six or seven months I paid that interest and last month bought my telly and play-station back. It cost so much I could not get the laptop so paid the interest and went to pick it up this month. I was four days late and they sold it. I have used them for over 3 years, they know my name. FOUR DAYS LATE. I wish I could swear that I would never step foot in that fukin place again but my ever lasting need to fight the dreaded sickness means that one day soon I will cross the threshold and enter that dark emporium and swap another treasured possession for a few lousy quid.

				Well I have had a look at this unspecified weight listing for BO3 and I can see why that would look suspicious. Also thanks for the mention of DPR&#039;s policy on FE, pakchoi. I didn&#039;t know about that. I suppose having FE&#039;d consistently for Frank Matthews I didn&#039;t find it unusual. <br /><br />I only hope that my experience of BO3 - 2 perfect orders - proves to be the case for everyone, and that he keeps up this level of service. <br /><br />On the matter of pawning&nbsp; - as with shoplifting and prostitution - well I see these regrettable behaviours as a direct consequence of our stupid drug laws. How sad that what was once called the &#039;English solution&#039; has now all but vanished, where doctors would prescribe heroin to addicts.<br /><br />In less tabloid-dominated countries we can expect to present ourselves at a legal clinic and administer as much dope as we need for nothing. I think of this measure every time I hear of heroin related poverty. It is simply cruel on the part of legislators to permit this state of affairs to continue. The true cost provides an overall benefit to society, as the expense of setting up and maintaining free dope clinics is more than defrayed by the abolition of heroin-related crime and disorder.<br /><br />

				Very well said AgentLee. I&#039;ve watched many programmes on the subject. There was also a very good Guardian article on the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and how legalizing heroin would stop virtually all the negative issues. It&#039;s been tried not that long ago, and Brighton are prescribing diamorphine injections now, and opening up some rooms where users who buy street heroin can go to use in a safe, clean environment, Very forward thinking

If they don&#039;t repay they go on the &#039;shit list&#039; which means no-one will lend them anything again - so in a way it&#039;s sensible to pay back as you never know when you might need a helping hand.<br /><br />And lets be honest we&#039;re not talking big loans. The biggest I lent someone was $35 but I knew them quite well through my year on SR and I got it back no problems at all.

My friends have just opened an independent pub selling real ale and it&#039;s actually doing surprisingly well. I guess it depends on the area and the market for the type of pub you&#039;re running. I got fired very suddenly (they found out about my drug usage) and it&#039;s left me broke with a mortgage to pay and my partner still doesn&#039;t know. I&#039;m gonna pluck up the courage to tell her I&#039;ve lost it this week though. Started listing a lot of my belongings on ebay today. I just want this bloody gear to turn up to make life easier for a bit. Sorry for the rant.

I&#039;ve watched many programmes on the subject. There was also a very good Guardian article on the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and how legalizing heroin would stop virtually all the negative issues.

Stigma is diminished and drug use is seen as being mainstream. <br /><br />I am also encouraged by the responses I find to the &#039;true cost&#039; argument: that is, the total social cost of this or that policy in terms of personal suffering, crime, cost of criminal proceedings and punishment, efficacy of punishment regarding recidivism and so on. In short people are more willing to listen to alternatives - especially when the alternatives (such as decriminalised and free&nbsp; supervised usage) are far more sane than the effective persecution of poor people who use some drugs.<br /><br />

Tought shit basically, they won&#039;t chase you for small amounts but assume your address may well be marked from that point on. Time ot find another drop.<br /><br />Darktime - would be cool if you could hook up TN with your local top gear! £10 a point is OLD SKOOOL! :) In fact fuck it I want to know where you live, hook me up now ;)

I&#039;ve sent TN a message asking him to cancel my order or confirm shipment so I can use my coins elsewhere. It&#039;s a shitty situation for him but he has to respect our position as customers.<br /><br />Work found loads of shit on my computer when I was off sick. I won&#039;t go into detail but I&#039;m fucked and they are probably going to take action against me. :(<br /><br />Fuck, it makes me feel sick just thinking about what&#039;s gonna happen.

				So, dabbler, are you pretending to go to work, if you&#039;ve not told the wife? Not my business, I know. Hey, Japan, was it you who kindly gave some coins to that jasper character earlier?

				HI londonpride, are you not on a methadone script or anything? If not, get to the pharmacy and&nbsp; buy some co-codamol for the clucks. There&#039;s instructions online for a cold water extraction of the codeine so you can just take the codeine and give your liver a bit of a rest if you need to take a lot. <br />Morning all. My dispater order just arrived, it looks like a generous 0.3, without scales it&#039;s anyone&#039;s guess. I had my works organised so everything was ready from last night. I had to move in with my folks after splitting up with my daughter&#039;s mother and being kicked out of the house, and not having a job, so even though I said my works were organised, they were still hidden in a shoe box in my room, and they&#039;ve been used before, only by me (my meth pharmacy isn&#039;t a needle exchange, there isn&#039;t one in my fucking town!) I borrowed some jif lemon from the kitchen (no citric, no needle exchange) and locked myself in the downstairs loo. Cooked up all the 0.3, drew half up, cooled it down, miraculously found a vein in my wrist first time and injected...<br />2 minutes later I felt a mild rush and my lids became slightly, SLIGHTLY, heavier. It&#039;s very very mild gear, not even up to the standard of TopNotch&#039;s cheaper &quot;street&quot; gear. I would not recommend it, at all. Can someone (possibly sweetpoison as I think you&#039;re getting loads of different stuff today) please compare this dispater crap to BestOn3&#039;s gear for me, or to c63amg&#039;s or FrankMatthews? I would appreciate it lots. Thanks for reading this essay first thing in the morning, lots of love to you all. Peace xx

And like he says - his crew are looking for stuff every day, so they get stock pretty much everyday then if i understood correctly, so sunday orders are going to be sent today then i believe,&nbsp; but its not 100%<br />I&#039;m waiting for postie as well, very annoying situation, it&#039;s may be anything from 10.50-to 12.00 :( and it&#039;s not a fact i&#039;m going to get anything today<br />&nbsp;i didn&#039;t have my subs this morning, so withdrawing a little bit :(<br />2 NoAddedSugar - i&#039;m expecting from dispater, when by the way did you order? Yesterday? the day before? And also expecting from BO3 and TN,- i ll write a review when tested and if they arrive :)<br />Japan is wright - bitbargain is the best, the easiest, the fastest option

				Oh yeah, Japan. I forgot about those ones. I have Gastritis so ibuprofen gives me great stomach ache, and you can&#039;t do the cold water extraction with ibuprofen. I don&#039;t think you can anyway! But, ibuprofen is better for your liver than paracetamol anyway, in high doses. God, I&#039;m so pissed off by how pants dispater&#039;s gear is. I actually did 3/4 of what looked like just over 0.3 possibly. I thought there was a chance it could be strong, so I erred on the side of caution. Well, he doesn&#039;t claim it&#039;s excellent anyway, I&#039;ve never seen such a plain, up front listing &quot;HEROIN 0.3g&quot; , no picture. Ha. oh well, you live and learn. I&#039;m not FE-ing for F Matthews though, he can F off. Hehehe. I think, If Mr. Notch isstill away at the weekend, I&#039;ll get one from BO3 and one from c63. Anyone got any fun plans today? I have to go to the horrid, patronizing Job Centre. God, I hate that place....

				Morning all, well a bunch of orders came through that were marked in transit the same day as dispater&#039;s gear but it HASN&#039;T turned up :(<br /><br />So no opiates for me today.<br /><br />Bit bummed to hear dispaters gear isn&#039;t rated in the pin.

I can cane a gram of good gear in 24 hours, a gram of crap gear in a few hours...<br /><br />Sigh... maybe dispater actually posts the day after he marks in transit, or he posts at a box that has no 5.30 pick up....<br /><br />I wish I could smoke BestOn3&#039;s gear as it is ok but it&#039;s SO fricking dirty my lungs start burning and seizing up straight away.<br /><br />Oh well, rant over, sorry guys/girls.<br /><br /><br /><br />Very generous offer Japan, you&#039;re deffo spreading good karma about here.

I immediately learned about BTC, spent a few days transferring my Sterling into Euro&#039;s via Transferwise, sent the Euro&#039;s to Bitstamp (this whole process took 5 days!), bought some BTC, sent them to my desktop wallet then ordered from SR.

				Yeah, londonpride. I believe you, that you&#039;re in need and not trying to take advantage of Japan&#039;s generosity. It&#039;s even harder on here to tell if someone is legitimately in need or just being a scrounger. And Japan is incredibly decent, and you are obviously and clearly grateful. On a day that&#039;s pissing it down with rain outside, it certainly has brightened up here. I&#039;ve also been pleased to see genuine intelligence and humour here. I have never seen the like in the street users I&#039;ve met in the past. I have never met a Jack Kerouac or Burroughs character in the real world, even though I thought they must exist. I&#039;ve always thought I was the odd one out (in no way am I comparing myself here!). In my meetings at the drug worker place I&#039;ve always been told that I don&#039;t seem the type to be a user, and I&#039;ve always thought, why?, what is the type? The stereotype moron thief? Well, those are the only ones I&#039;ve met so I can understand that being the general consensus at Addaction. I knew that there must be creatives and funny people and genuine people who like to use drugs, it&#039;s only society who think that drugs and stupidity go hand in hand. I have been stupid in the past though, ended up with an addiction I couldn&#039;t afford and on the streets, sleeping rough, begging in the town center, but, I&#039;ve never intentionally hurt someone. Anyway, I think my point is, it&#039;s nice to know we&#039;re not all stereotypes, and I&#039;m lucky and honoured to have had this chance to &quot;meet&quot; you all.

				Hey dabbler, the mods are always saying that they have nothing to do with the SR site, they&#039;re purely forum moderators and you are to&nbsp; either &quot;report vendor&quot;, pressing this will bring up options and a text field, or use the resolve/cancel button. If yours is still &quot;processing&quot; then cancel is available after 4 days from placing the order. TN is getting a reputation for being notoriously hard to contact

				Regarding Tar, I made a thread a few hours ago asking about the different types of heroin and got this great reply.........<br />#1 and #2 you never need to worry about..that is for morphine base and unrefined heroin.....<br />#3 is usually for smoking, like chasing the dragon on foil and is a base and weaker than #4...it needs to be combined with acid to be iv&#039;d and can not be snorted...though some will claim they can snort...its not water soluble so you will not get high<br />tar and powder are both #4 that were created in different ways.....generally powder is more refined and therefore more pure and potent.....but tar has additional properties and can be smoked as is so there is a big following here on sr for it....and I have personally bought from almost every us vendor and the most potent stuff on the road is tar...and if you are a iv user....it has legs!!!! it last for a whole day and you wont wake up sick the next morning like you do with powder.....<br />anyways...pm if you need any help <br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked the black tar in the past, but never injected it. I&#039;m keen to try though now

				aaahhh, there you go. You made me type a pointless message. Never mind. My order from BestOn3 has been marked in transit now. Hopefully that will arrive tomorrow. I discovered that ASDA have a needle exchange in the in-store pharmacy. It must have never been used, they had no idea what they were doing and no names in the book. I asked the pharmacist for a bag of 2mls, she disappeared and brought an assistant from the back, who just happened to be a friend of my parents. That was buttock clenching, lower iris puckering moment. I&#039;ve not seen this woman for 10 years, she may not recognize me. One can only hope. Also, they gave me a paper bag with 5 x long orange pins, 5 x blue, 5 x syringes and 5 x wipes. No citric. That&#039;s what I needed most! Brilliant. I have no citric/ vit C at all. You wouldn&#039;t believe how hard it is to get new pins near here. Where I used to live, on the south coast, you could get them in every pharmacy and in the drug treatment place, probably even Toys &#039;R us! edit. What a nice guy Japan

				No shops like that here. There&#039;s one off licence, that has a few odds and sods, groceries wise. I live in a dead end ex-mining village, and I was told in a neighbouring town Boots Chemist when I went to the Job Center earlier, that I would have to go 13 miles to find a Boots that had an exchange in :/ ! There really is nothing going on here, it&#039;s a dump. In fact, it&#039;s an arse, it&#039;s the arse of England. Fuck all to do, impossible to get drugs and zero chance of meeting women. I had to move here because I lost my flat on the beautiful south coast, with it&#039;s easily available drugs (most of the time) and a bounty of ladies and pubs and clubs (most of the time). I have Jif lemon

Still, you live, you learn, you make all the same mistakes again. Now I need to see what footy is on.

				I received my BO3 order this morning, you can&#039;t fault the guy with his delivery time and his stealth was nice, but I have to say, the gear is pants. Dispater&#039;s was better. I literally felt nothing from roughly half 0.3, I&#039;ve not been back on the gear long. I should have felt something. I tell a lie, I feel itchy. For some reason I&#039;m getting the histamine itching, but no buzz at all. It is the cheaper BO3 gear, but it isn&#039;t &quot;cheap&quot;. Where for art thou TopNotch!? At least my c63 order is in the post now. I can hope for Saturday, or more realistically, next week. This has really gone to pot without good old TN. Can you see yet, londonpride? Was it good gear?

				I don&#039;t think that&#039;s in dispute, Lanark. I just did the rest of my BO3 gear. If this was TopNotch&#039;s, 0.3 it would have put me on my arse! There is definitely a shortage of top notch (hehe) UK heroin vendors. It&#039;s ridiculous, having to order from abroad and have to potentially wait a week for your drugs. Although, during the last attack, and when this thread was started, it took me over a week to get my TopNotch gear anyway. It is always worth it though, even his cheaper stuff beats the living shit out of Dispater&#039;s and BO3&#039;s (I have only tried BO3&#039;s cheaper gear, there&#039;s not that much difference in the price,&nbsp; I doubt there being much in the quality. Has anyone here tried both of BO3&#039;s gear? Also, has anyone noticed how consistent the quality has been from Dispater and BO3? TopNotch&#039;s has been the same exact gear every time, in my opinion.

What the chances of it to be seized? Or to be scammed ( i didn&#039;t FE on either of them)?<br />I had so much hope for TN&#039;s as its always 24, maximum 48 hours delivery!<br />Should i pm him? What shall i do peeps?!.?&nbsp; I can&#039;t explain how i feel,- that never happen to me before ,- not getting TN&#039;s<br />&quot; NoAddedSugar- yes i work, but on holidays this week, was planing to have a good time, but looks like it&#039;s not going to happen :(

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />So yesterday I smoked my way through around 600mg of bo3&#039;s standard uk&#039;s cheapest. It didn&#039;t do shit. So disappointing, oh well.<br /><br />Anyway the good news is I managed to sell some stuff on ebay and I can pay back agentlee&#039;s favor today as I can buy some coins. I&#039;m not holding out much hope for TN&#039;s gear to arrive tomorrow so I&#039;m going to place an order with bo3 again but for his &quot;no joke&quot; stuff. It&#039;s a shame we don&#039;t have many more uk to uk vendors selling decent brown. <br /><br />Has anyone smoke bo3&#039;s &quot;no joke&quot; stuff? <br /><br />Cheers

				Hey poison, I don&#039;t think your orders will have been seized, it&#039;s internal UK mail, and the stealth is adequate from these blokes. There&#039;s no reason for you not to PM TopNotch, I would. Also, make your point in the subject field, I find I get more responses from him that way. Maybe type your question in the subject and elaborate in the general text field. You&#039;ll be fine if you didn&#039;t FE, perhaps it&#039;s just a localized problem with the post.

I&#039;m staying away from the other UK vendors whom we&#039;ve discussed. Basically, they&#039;re shit. but I place dispater&#039;s above BO3&#039;s cheaper 0.3g crap. I feel completely straight now having banged up BO3&#039;s gear 2 hours ago. What a complete waste of money.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember ever having come across such shit IRL in all my time of using! Besides the stuff that was floating around that crystallized after it was cooked when it was cooling down and would get stuck in the pin and provide plenty dirty hits. Did any of you ever come across that shite? Or stuff with brick dust in? Oh, there&#039;s the Anthrax gear too, and some stuff with benzo&#039;s in, that killed a few folk in Brighton and Glasgow.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see you folks later, got a meeting with the drugs team.

				Hey, I got my order from TN this morning. Also a message saying that he was struggling to find anything decent so could be a bit of a while before listings are back up. Got my order though so that&#039;s good.<br /><br />It seems that bo3&#039;s is a bit of a gamble. sometimes its good and other times its pants. I have been using for nearly 20 years and his afghan floored me last week but then I hear it was hardly doing anything to someone this week. I think he may be dishing out more than one type.<br /><br />I am going to get some pink diconals from jj70 as they are a nice buz and keep the sickness at bay. Thanks to whoever said jj70 was kosher, it was a couple of pages ago and i can&#039;t remember your name, but thanks for the heads up. <br /><br />Thanks for the info on black tar, I also heard that you can smoke it, infact I smoked some that I got from the usa and it was a bit of a let down. Also very hard to run on the foil. I would like to try a good one so if anyone has any clues let me know. <br /><br />Has anyone tried amg yet and if so is it any good?

				The only reason there was an influx of people using Beston3 is because TN was messing about and you can order from Beston3 up until 5-6pm and receive it the next day. It&#039;s the same on the street sometimes, it&#039;s good gear and sometimes it&#039;s not so good. I do know that Beston3 changes his gear on a regular basis so it does vary from batch to batch - I ordered a couple of weeks ago off him and got some seriously strong ass shit. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had both his current cheap stuff and his better stuff - and there is definitely a noticeable difference.<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke my gear so can&#039;t comment on how it runs - but in a pin I think it&#039;s not too bad, personally. But I often mix my gear with diconal, for the extra BOOOOM.

(marked in transit on tuesday)<br /><br />Edit: got another question,- i have 3 orders on my order list including TN&#039;s all of them were marked in transit the same day, on tuesday and were all saying 17 days to auto finalize, but today i discovered that two orders are saying 15 days left as they are supposed to say, but TN order says 16, what does it mean?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My dispater order was marked in transit Tuesday morning and it showed today... Sometimes the mail is delayed by a day or even two in some areas due to various reasons. if it doesn&#039;t show by Saturday I&#039;d be worried it&#039;s gone walkabout.<br /><br />I think the autofinalise times are done from the time the order was made. For example, you could place order #1 at 9am on Monday and order #2 at 5pm on Monday.&nbsp; On Tuesday order #1 will click over to 16 days at 09:01 while order #2 will stay as 17 days until 17:01. That make sense? LoL<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Gear report - I am sat here smoking dispaters gear and it&#039;s crap. Not utter crap, I can feel a bit but I think I am going to have to smoke the whole g to maybe get a nod. It&#039;s a bugger cos it&#039;s the nod I&#039;m after... Oh well, i&#039;ve had worse, but been spoilt by TopNotch and c63amg.&nbsp; Annoying, cos last week after 0.15 of dispaters gear I was throwing up and pinned to fuck.... meh<br /><br />

				Hey poison, TN says he gets literally 100&#039;s of messages a day, and he&#039;s not the best at replying. I ordered some 25i-NBOMe<br />last week, was marked in transit the next day but took the full working week to arrive and had good comms with the vendor<br />who swore he posted it when he said. I received an appointment for something on 3/5/13 which had the post mark 26/4/13 too<br />1st class stamp on it also. You can never tell with Royal Mail, they&#039;re not known for being very good. I wouldn&#039;t start worrying<br />about your stuff being seized yet though. This an just happen.

				I found that UK doctors are normally alright to prescribe you what you ask (on reasonable level! ),- last time i&#039;ve been to a doctor and asked for tramadol, with my prescription i could have up to 10 caps a day, also they gave me temazepam ( not sure but i think it is benzo as well, isn&#039;t it?<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp;NAD - thanks for compliment about my english<br /><br />Regarding needle exchange service,-there are packages of 2ml or 1 ml syringes. Every package has 10 syringes, swabs, spoons with filters, citric acid and used needle containers. So every time you come for a new pack, you bring the container with used syringes back to them. They don&#039;t ask for name, ID or&nbsp; address.<br />:)

				Hey people,<br /><br />I have come across a vendor going by the name &quot;UK Suppliers&quot;. Delivery time in uk is 1 - 3 days so i imagine if you order in the morning you should get by next day. They stock #3. smallest listing is 0.42 for 1/4 g.

				Well, they specify what their order is posted in i.e. a &quot;jiffy envelope&quot; which is stupid of them, and I don&#039;t like buying from vendors who have their fingers in many pies, take our friend TopNotch for example, just dealt in heroin. No messing about. A specialist, if you will

				Darktime - I got the wrong end of the stick. It&#039;s a nice idea you have there, and if I ever get the desperate sweats I may be sending you my coin in future. I pray to St. Bill it never comes to that.<br /><br />Hey Sugar - I get the IP message quite a lot. The forums have been dicky ever since&nbsp; I began using them. I have no idea why it happens, but as you can see it&#039;s not just you. Perhaps we should ask Scout about it.<br /><br />Also, about the link - exchange supplies do sell to individuals and they are discreet about it. They do all safer injecting equipment, from vit c and citric acid to swabs and sterilisation tablets (for used needles, not you). I think it&#039;s quite cheap and if you do not have an exchange within reach it is perhaps your best bet for equipment.

				Do you guys feels comfortable giving your/drop details to a vendor without pgp?&nbsp; That website that deletes doesn&#039;t cut it.&nbsp; Dispater used to have one so knows how to set it up.&nbsp; This unfortunately rules me out.&nbsp; C63&#039;s gear really is in a league of its own, 2 days to UK.&nbsp; Consistency is key and that is s&#039;thing TN has in spades also avoids customs.&nbsp; Anyone tempted to try SuperTrips #4? FM&#039;s months ago was incredible.&nbsp; Read ST&#039;s has great high but short acting.

				Morning all. Sorry to hear that Japanman, isn&#039;t that who you gave the generous loan to? I hope it&#039;s just a mistake or something. My order from c63 arrived today, ordered on Wednesday, I&#039;m seriously impressed with that speed, and the stealth was fantastic, and in my humble opinion, this is the best gear in the known universe! It&#039;s amazing! I would do man love with c63 given half the chance now, (or, love, if c63 is of the lady variety). I&#039;m so happy, I took a 0.1 ish hit and I&#039;m nodding out. I am about to go and help my dad with some handyman stuff so, a bit irresponsible, but I kind of needed it, but was more just&nbsp; curious about the quality (and was dreaming about drugs, as one does). Oh, I hope you&#039;re all sorted so I don&#039;t piss you all off. I can&#039;t get over this, it&#039;s the best heroin I&#039;ve ever had. The stealth held me up about 5 min(s)!, without going into detail, it&#039;s great, and delivery time from Holland, 2 days??? Amazing. I fucking love c63, Silk Road, and all of you. Oh, if any of you support Everton or Chelsea, let us know if you want to watch it &quot;together&quot;, there&#039;s cricfree.tv or something, we can watch and chat on here.&nbsp; Let me know guys, Good luck with your coins Japan, see you all this afternoon. Peace

				Hello Noadded sugar.&nbsp; Nice to hear some reviews of gear.&nbsp; C63&#039;s current batch ( and I have sampled the last 4 I believe) is the strongest I have had.&nbsp; I have also tried SmileaWhile&#039;s #4 and I honestly may prefer C63&#039;s #3.&nbsp; The #3 sedates me more for the evening and #4 charges me up for the morning.&nbsp; I only smoke/snort tho.&nbsp; Also, Frank Matthew&#039;s #4 for $126 is a steal.&nbsp; I had a batch once from him and I rate it as amazing (with no tolerance).<br /><br />If anyone can jump on the samples he offers, I recommend it.&nbsp; His stealth is the best I have ever seen on the road as well.&nbsp; However, domestic and reliable with good gear cannot be beaten.&nbsp; TopNotch will hopefully be back soon!&nbsp; Taking a break for a while tho so I can wait.&nbsp; 1 week on SAW&#039;s gear lead to brutal WD&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure nothing like for a regular user but caught me off guard for the amount I was using.

Yes, this thread has moved on slightly from the original TopNotch theme. <br />We all told you, poison, if you believe in it, it will come. sort of &quot;Field of dreams&quot; reference in there for the old farts. Is anyone watching the tragically brilliant Eurovision? These lyrics are priceless. <br />I&#039;m incredibly happy with this c63 gear, and with the time it took to arrive, sorry if I&#039;m banging on about it, bare in mind, I&#039;d just had BO3&#039;s cheaper stuff, and before that, Dispater&#039;s, so I think my opiate receptors have been neglected. Oh, Lee, did I say I&#039;d ordered from Exchange Supplies? I&#039;m using a vitamin C effervescent drink thing to dissolve my gear, not ideal.

				Hi peeps!<br />I think i&#039;ve overdosed today.<br />I&#039;ve cooked normal/usual amount of TN&#039;s strong afgan and a couple of minutes later after i shoot it i&nbsp; fainted (for 30 min or so), when i goback i could not understand where i was, what was going on and the syringe was pricking my palm. All day today i couldn&#039;t see properly,- just couldn&#039;t focus my eyes, i think i&#039;m just starting to feel normal now. Either the H is stronger this time or may be cut with smth like benzos or fentanyl. Has anyone who had his last batch noticed anything?<br />Regarding junkie life in russia,- i&#039;d say its bad,-&nbsp; H quality these days is very poor, from what i&#039;ve heard,- they say it&#039;s probably maximum 20% of H in powder which is sold as H. I&nbsp; came off it before it became bad. Also there is not much junkies can do now to treat withdrawals, because codeine containing tablets are not available without prescription any more and in russia there is no substitute treatment program. The only thing people are left with now is - pregabalin (Lyrica).<br />&nbsp;Here in the UK no one seems to know about poppies growing everywhere (in my area anyway), because they grow everywhere, so not sure if anyone harvests them here.<br />Regarding renaming the thread,- if you tell me how to do, i&#039;m quite happy to give it any name you suggest :)

				Fucking hell poison, are you alright? Should you maybe poop to a&amp;e? They won&#039;t phone the police. TopNotch&#039;s gear seemed pretty clean to me, but he&#039;s got new stuff hasn&#039;t he. It could be cut with benzo&#039;s. When you cooked up the powder, after the liquid cooled down, did it crystallize in the spoon? Did it look different at all? Are you feeling sleepy now still? If you do stay at home and go to bed, prop some pillows up to your side to keep you from rolling onto your back. Did you get any chest pain after injecting? Anything different than a normal strong hit? I&#039;d definitely go to the hospital if you think you could have OD&#039;d

				Really loving this thread, it seems to be full of cool people :)<br /><br />Russia is definitely much less liberal than Europe in general, so it&#039;s way easier to get into trouble with the law, and the repercussions can be bad, and I&#039;m talking really bad! So you&#039;ve gotta be careful with any banned substances over there. <br /><br />One of the coolest people I ever met while still there was this guy who&#039;d done pretty much every drug known to man, read a lot of Castaneda&#039;s stuff and played guitar and drums. I heard a lot of stuff from him regarding the cliches that are prevalent in society and the lies we are being constantly fed.

				To be a complete kiss arse, and as I now have the power I have to abuse it, I&#039;ve given all of you a +1 thank you. Well. it is genuinely a thank you for you all restoring my faith in humanity. Now, I&#039;m going over old ground here, I&#039;ve mentioned it before, but I didn&#039;t expect that on a forum for the most infamous site on the deepweb, if not the entire interweb world, I would find such genuine and generous people, such helpful people and eloquent and just plain nice people. You all unfortunately have to make do with the karma and positive vibes at the moment, I can&#039;t afford to buy the needy a bag, like the generous Japanman, I&#039;m living on the rock n&#039; roll with debts up to the eye balls (although I can see the stupidity of me wasting what little money I have, but, if I didn&#039;t allow myself this, I swear I would go blind with boredom or jump in the bath with a toaster). You should all know, that when I check for unread messages and I find there&#039;s no posts in this thread since I last checked (5 minutes previously) that my heart sinks slightly, because I look forward so much to reading the words from my fellow like-minded travelers of the road. You all have a little corner in my imagination somewhere reserved that I keep sterile and ready for you to get high together with me in my mind. (This is so corny, it&#039;s making me cringe already, c63&#039;s gear is that good, 3 hits and I&#039;ve been floating all day and night and coming up with loved up drivel.) I hope to chat with you all when you wake up. But, by that time, I could be asleep! Take care all. Peace&nbsp; :P ;)

				Hope you&#039;re alright SP my friend.<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t have been cut with Benzo&#039;s as 99% of them are not water-soluble so would not cook up in a spoon no matter how much citric you added, it would purely turn to a jelly like substance. I also very much doubt he cut it with fentanyl as that is major expensive when talking weight comparisons to H.<br /><br />Not sure what conclusion to make from this - but the main thing is you&#039;re still with us Bro, just be careful in the future.<br /><br />That is one problem buying H over the internet you never know if someone has gone completely mental and poisoned their batch (not that I&#039;m saying he has) but it&#039;s anonymous so potentially someone could get away with mass murder. On the street it&#039;s the same to a certain extent, but you hear from word of mouth who&#039;s got good gear etc etc...&nbsp;

				@NoAddedSugar..I play the guitar too! :)<br /><br />Yeah it&#039;s a bit off-topic, but you opened a can of worms there cos once I get started talking about music I can&#039;t stop! <br /><br />I like, in no particular order: Guns&#039;n&#039;Roses, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Metallica, AC/DC, Black Label Society, Disturbed, Killswitch Engage, Iron Maiden, Avenged Sevenfold, The Donnas, Pantera, Down, Anthrax, Arch Enemy, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Iggy Pop, Jimi Hendrix, Kiss, Motorhead, Randy Rhoads for his awesome playing, Seether, The Offspring, Bad Religion, The Distillers, Rage Against the Machine, Rob Zombie, Soundgarden, RHCP, ...that&#039;s what I can think of off the top of my head. My all-time favourite guitarists are Hammett, Iommi, Rhoads, Cantrell and of course Jimi. :)<br /><br />Peace, Love &amp; Heavy Metal \m/&nbsp; ;D

				Good afternoon fellow travelers. So how are we all?&nbsp; <br /><br />Sweetpoison! Post something so we know you&#039;re ok!<br /><br /><br />Well, the 2grams of dispaters gear I ordered are gone and it was weird stuff. I smoked and smoked and smoked and never got any higher than ALMOST nodding. It was strange to say the least. I&#039; would avoid. It kept the sickness away for a couple of days but no high to speak of.<br /><br />Now TopNotch has some grams back up but I am wondering if I am better off with c63amg. I&#039;m not sure if TopNotch is back to next day delivery or not... plus sweetpoison seemed to have had an issue...unless she was just confused cos she had a wee bit too much?<br /><br />Hope&nbsp; you are all able to enjoy this sunshine.

My friend&#039;s sister&#039;s boyfriend got me into it, I loved the old heavy metal, I like most music, but my favourite genre has to be punk, in all forms.<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit concerned for Sweetpoison, I wish she&#039;d just come on for 2 minutes at least. <br /><br />Is anyone watching football today?

I bought it broken, with the intention of fixing it after someone destroyed the floats in the carbs, then gave it back a year later , still not running.

XXXX has 100% positive feedback though, but only been on the Road for 21 days. Most of the feedback on his vendor page is FE&#039;s. Who writes &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot; on an account that&#039;s 21 days old? That&#039;s faith. I don&#039;t think a new vendor should have the cheek to ask for FE for customers with under 10 transactions. I think he should work on establishing himself on the Road.

This form was rare and used normally only in drug trials and in specialist diconal addiction clinics.<br /><br />Usage [edit]<br /><br />Dipipanone is now unavailable in most countries of the world either by laws prohibiting its medicinal use as in the United States or by falling out of production as more modern analgesics took its market share. Great Britain, Northern Ireland and South Africa are known to continue to use the substance but it is infrequently prescribed.<br /><br />Chemistry [edit]<br /><br />Chemically, dipipanone belongs to the class of opioids called the 4,4-diphenylheptane-3-ones. It closely resembles methadone, the only structural difference being the N,N-dimethyl moiety of methadone being replaced with a piperidine ring. Other related compounds with equivalent activity where the piperidine ring has been replaced by other groups, include the morpholine derivative phenadoxone, as well as the corresponding pyrrolidine derivative.[3] The general procedure for synthesis is illustrated by nucleophilic attack of diphenylacetonitrile on 2-chloro-1-piperidyl-propane. The resulting aminonitrile is then converted to the ethyl ketone with ethyl magnesium bromide by way of the ketimine which is hydrolyzed by cold aqueous acid.[4][5]<br /><br />Medical use and recreational abuse [edit]<br /><br />Prescription of dipipanone is discouraged apart from in exceptional circumstances, because of the perceived risk of abuse - the BNF marks the substance as &quot;less suitable for prescribing&quot; along with other older compounds such as pethidine and pentazocine with unusual abuse patterns. The combination with cyclizine leads to a very strong &quot;rush&quot; if the drug is injected, however the tablets contain insoluble binders which led to many limb amputations and some fatalities (as with temazepam). During the late 1970s to early 1980s in the UK, many deaths were blamed on misuse of this preparation. As supplies became unavailable, opiate users would mix crushed methadone tablets or Physeptone ampoules with crushed Valoid (a cyclizine containing antihistamine) tablets, in an attempt to replicate the effect of Diconal.<br />

BTW -&nbsp; from Harley Street Doctors in London you can still buy them on a private script (diamorphine amps) if you know the corrupt doctors, 10-15 years ago it was a wide spread occurrence, I used to get boxes of them weekly, although they&#039;ve tightened up on it these days, however it still goes on. <br /><br />But regarding dicanol and H - be very, very careful - it&#039;s so powerful mixed together, it&#039;s easy to OD. Lost a few good friends many years ago to it. And another word of advice - a lot of the dicanol that is sold on SR is generic shit - occasionally a good batch comes in but not often.&nbsp;

				Hi, peeps!<br />Yes :) i&#039;m still with you, thanks for being worried about me. TN&#039;s H seems really different this time. When i cook it - it look usual but feels completely different. I&#039;ll try to explain - I irl don&#039;t smoke but if i use H i like smoking, so! this time i didn&#039;t want to smoke at all but could hardly move around. Today i did a small dose - got nice opioid buzz (didn&#039;t faint lol) and then.. didn&#039;t want to smoke and was sleeping half a day. I feel alright now, not withdrawing yet. So this H is quite strong then. Because i wasn&#039;t taking subutex fro 4 days, i would be already withdrawing if all H went of my system. I put it away for now, i ll come back to it sometime later, so back to subs from tomorrow :) And, Yes, the next time im purchasing H on SR i&#039;d try c63..,- so many compliments on his H here :)<br />&nbsp;I didn&#039;t have any chest pains or any abnormality,- just gone from usual dose.<br />So much to do now- holidays gone, back to work on tuesday + rising qualification course home work which i didn&#039;t do at all (lots of reading and wring for me tomorrow :(&nbsp; ), was too busy testing all SR vendors&#039; H :))<br /><br />I&#039;ll see you tomorrow

				I tried subutex all suggested rutes - IV, snort, sublingual,- not a thing! I don&#039;t feel anything! <br />2&nbsp; NAD - are you on metadon? Cuz with the accordance to what i&#039;ve heard about it is that if you take metad regularly as substitute treatment, at some point you ll stop having buzz from it, is that true? ( i&#039;ve never tried metad myself)<br />In Ukraine (next door to russia, ex USSR) they have subutex/metadon substitute treatment and there are big queues to sub treat., no one wants metad.,- they say sub always gives you nice buzz and you can use other opiats when you want, just don&#039;t take sub that day, and those who on metad. they say in 2 months they stop feeling it at all and cant use any opiats because they don&#039;t feel a thing

Both Subutex and Suboxone can be snorted or IV&#039;d to get a buzz - however Subutex is stronger due the less amount of Naxloxone in it.<br /><br />DO NOT EITHER USE WHILE ON OPIATES - AS YOU WILL GO INTO INSTANT WITHDRAWALS&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Suboxone : (hexagon), CAN BE SNORTED, AND INJECTED.<br /><br />Subutex:&nbsp; &nbsp;(can be both small, or larger oval sized), CAN BE SNORTED, CAN BE INJECTED. <br /><br />Subutex snorted actually gives me a very pleasant high - bit like a more energetic H buzz. <br /><br />My personal opinion is that Subutex snorted is better than most prsecription opiates, such as OXY&#039;s (obviously, depending on the amount used).<br /><br />Yeah the buzz is not as good a H but for me (personally) I have a soft spot for Subutex - and have had some extremely good nods off it. Some people don&#039;t like the stuff, but for me I really like it. Whether or not my tolerance is high or low at the time has no effect on the feeling - obviously having to dose higher when tolerance levels are higher is a must.<br /><br />If you ever decide to IV either look into how it&#039;s done as it&#039;s different to preparing a H hit as heating it with citric will just turn it into a sludge - but if prepared correctly it could be a very nice surprise.

SR and Breaking Bad on a Tuesday morning. Its enough to make one order in some crystal. I have never tried it but every time i watch Breaking Bad i want to try it. I am slightly nervous about trying it as I have no will power at all and could end up in trouble. Likewise if I buy H i do it all regardless of the amount.

				Breaking Bad is awesome, gutted I have to wait til August or whenever for the next series. I always wanted to try crystal, so, when I discovered the SR it was my second order. It&#039;s pretty similar to crack, just a bit of a clearer high, I believe I said the same thing at the start of this thread. I was pretty sick today with withdrawls. I have an order from Saturday marked in transit today from c63, knowing I would wait, I put in a small Dispater order on Sunday. That was marked in transit yesterday morning, I was waiting for postie today, but nothing for me. How sad. I&#039;ve just done the old filters to perk me up. I&#039;ve been helping my dad lay some flooring, been useless all morning and up to now. Gutted. Hope it arrives tomorrow

				Hey SP<br />get a piece of tin foil and make a tube about 3 inches long,this is put in the mouth to suck up the vapor.get another flat piece about 7inches by 5 inches and put the h in a small pile on the foil.hold a lighter underneath it and suck it up.theres all sorts of personalised ways peeps do it but you will learn the best way for you.dont let it run off the foil though!Try to &#039;run&#039; the liquid in a line up and down the foil dont just keep it on the same spot or it will burn.

				Thanks for info. I&#039;ve heard they call it to chase dragon or smth like that,- is it because&nbsp; (if i understood correct) when you burn your H from underneeth the foil it turns into liquid and you have to let it run down the foil and chase it with the inhaling pipe?

				You just want aluminum foil, it&#039;s sold in any corner shop or super market. Bacofoil is a brand, I&#039;ve used it fine. Avoid the very cheap very thin foil like &quot;happy shopper&quot;, that&#039;s crap. You can unroll the tube you put in your mouth when you&#039;ve finished, smoke concentrates into a brown thin goo inside.

				Most consider the cheap foil the best.Personal choice though obviously.As NAS said,after your smoke,if youve got nothing left,unfold/roll your &#039;tooter&#039; and there will be a little gear stuck to the inside which you can smoke.If you got lots of h,just let it build up until a)it runs out while your smoking a line or b)If it blocks,heat it a little with the lighter and drip it onto your foil.I&#039;ve even picked this &#039;collect&#039; off the toot and cooked it up as sometimes your collect can be stronger than your h!!Hardly any cut as well cos you&#039;ve smoked that and whats collected is pretty pure.<br />SS,ask Japan about the fentanyl cos I think I remember him saying it isnt as strong as it used to be.<br />Why dont you try some &#039;refined opium&#039;?Its a reasonable price and the refined stuff you can smoke in a pipe.Ive had it in tea and it was lovely.I had been out raving all night,had e&#039;s and whizz,was flying!Had about 0.2gr in some tea and within 30 mins was buzzed right up!Heavy legs,stoned feel in the eyes,big cheesy grin.It was very nice.Horrortrips seems like a nice guy to get it from but his isn&#039;t much good for smoking he said.

				I agree with Dabs, I only ordered from Dispater because I wanted something fast while I waited for c6e&#039;s delivery. Rockchick, c63&#039;s stealth is far superior to any other I&#039;ve had. I&#039;m not sure it would get past sniffer dogs, without going into detail, it&#039;s not vacuum packed. However, if your parents/other half/priest opens it, they won&#039;t have a Scooby-Doo what&#039;s in there. C63 is definitely my new &quot;go to&quot; guy. <br />Pakchoi, Thank you, my Dispater order did arrive this morning, the quality is better than BO3&#039;s cheap stuff, it does do the job of keeping the withdrawals at bay. I&#039;m quite pissed off with myself at getting a bit of a habit again. My 12mls of meth doesn&#039;t hold me anymore. This time last year I was on over 120mls, so I&#039;d done quite a decent reduction, and was about to detox off the 12mls, and then I found the Road. My fault, I have no will power. I moved a long way from my previous address, where I was a big time user and part time runner, to a place where I couldn&#039;t score (not for lack of trying!). I&#039;ll get myself sorted again, doesn&#039;t take long. My girlfriend is moving over here, she doesn&#039;t know I&#039;ve started using again, so have to nip it in the bud soonish. Off topic, did you all read the phishing story from a n00b&#039;s first every visit to the road? A UK kid buying BTC from a road vendor (stupid first transaction, when advised about bitbargain from 3 people he still went back to the road vendor for more BTC) then went to a phising site and put his pin in on the login page. I feel sorry for him. Have a look at the clearnet page he visited first http://silkroaddrugs.wordpress.com/ poor little idiot. Here&#039;s the thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161278.msg1147309#msg1147309&nbsp; I had a look at the login page, it makes me angry.

				Hey sp I hope you got your smoke.<br />Darkt, I am looking for an alternative I can do every day, while working ext. Opium is to tricky to use in stealth or quickly. Also it does not have the kick i am looking for.<br />Jap80. thanks i am going to try some fentanyl powder and the nasal spray. I have done my research and they say its about 100x strong a morphine. We shall see.<br />I have also0 been getting pink diconals and they are really good. I use about 60 mil of green meth every day plus h on top and if i have a diconal in the morning i can get through the day without the green meth or h.

As well as understanding all too well being sick, I also have a similar situation to you. I moved to the arse end of nowhere to escape my heroin lifestyle, as you did. It&#039;s hard leaving good friends behind but definitely helped. I&#039;m also trying to reduce my meth so I can detox, but like you I keep nibbling at SilkRoad and putting myself back. I have decided that this c63 order will be the last for a while, I need to get my shit together. I would like to think I could keep using the forums and stay off the Road but it&#039;s bound to be a big old trigger...<br /><br /><br />Shifting Sands - You don&#039;t want to get yourself a fentanyl habit mate... There&#039;s a video on u toob of a girl who used ibogaine to come off a fent habit. She was EATING! one strong patch a day and had an unbelievable opiate tolerance, her bowels were completely impacted with crap, all she ate was icecream. <br /><br /><br />SweetPoison - there&#039;s an art to chasing the dragon. It&#039;s not hard though. My ex used to have a hell of a time co-ordinating inhaling and burning, half the time the smoke would go up and into the room, lost!

				Pakchoi, that&#039;ll be women and their lack of coordination, like reversing whilst driving! (I&#039;ll not make anymore sexist jokes, promise) <br /><br />SS, I&#039;d love to hear what you think of the Fentanyl. I&#039;m very interested myself, but have such little income at the moment, I can&#039;t afford to try it, I hope you don&#039;t mind being our guinea pig on this! <br /><br />Poison, there definitely is an art to chasing, the very first time I tried to do it, I had never seen it done, Only had the briefest of explanations, nothing like the detail that&#039;s been given in this thread. I burned it all off literally as soon as I put lighter to foil. Major waste. <br /><br />I&#039;m with you, Pakchoi, I&#039;m waiting on a c63 order which was marked &quot;in transit&quot; yesterday, that&#039;ll probably arrive Friday, do we think? As that will hopefully be as superior quality as the last order, it will be a good time to have a break. I wouldn&#039;t like to stop after a BO3 order, I&#039;d be craving a proper hit to have had, to go out with a bang, as it were. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to use the forums if I&#039;m not using either, but then again, knowing the quality of gear won&#039;t be a priority if we&#039;re not using!<br />Take care folks, speak laterz

				Hello Love, and welcome to our thread. As an IV user, I would prefer not to have it cut with anything, obviously, but as mentioned before, brick dust and rat poison, anthrax and other things have been used to cut Heroin with. I would, given the choice, prefer Benzo&#039;s. If you&#039;re smoking your gear, Benzo&#039;s mostly get burned off. That&#039;s pretty safe I imagine. Smoking is the safest ROA anyway.

Built up huge trust over a long period of time, then suddenly came up with a huge scam saying he needed FE off everyone for him to reduce prices and buy bulk of amazing product to then sell on etc etc etc. It has been estimated he scammed approximately 2 hundred thousand dollars or more then vanished into thin air.<br /><br />No-one saw it coming as he was seen as &#039;the best of SR&#039; - That was the first big scam, there have been others since but none anywhere close to that level - he really planned it and pulled off the ultimate scam.<br /><br />The moral of the story is, don&#039;t trust vendors. They&#039;re simply drug dealers on the internet, and should be treated that way.

				NAS its all good, I was an idiot to fall for the phishing site. However I don&#039;t think buying the btc in small amounts from a SR vendor makes me an idiot. For £100 I got 1.05 btc, its the same if not cheaper than what the bitcoins are selling for on ebayUK and so much more convenient. If the geezer wants to run off with my money, the most he&#039;s gonna nick is 100 quid as I won&#039;t purchase more than that at a time. If it happens, it happens, I am not going to be making daily transactions anyway...

				Yeah, his was the FE 420 scam, wasn&#039;t it? I think that I could have just coined that phrase, Tony FE420, or to be a complete prick. Wise words from Japan 1980. But we can only go so far and give so much advice. JJ says he hasn&#039;t got a bank account. From what I&#039;ve seen here, most balls ups happen to n00bs who are to eager to start buying. More haste, less speed. Take your time, do some research, do your homework, and stay in Escrow. These are words to live by whilst meandering down the Silk Road, It is a great place, full of wonder and delights, but they&#039;ll still be here tomorrow, so don&#039;t rush, don&#039;t make mistakes with privacy or security. Taking the time to do your homework properly, and talking to people who&#039;ve been around longer is invaluable. There&#039;s plenty of help in these forums, and some great people to chat to. People here will answer any questions you have. Stay safe, stay secure, shop smart, shop Esmart.

				Guys, Thanks for the opinions on Fentanyl. I have taken it all on board. I think I will go for the powder and also the nasal spray. I have found out that it passes through to the brain much quicker than other opiates and that makes it quite dangerous especially if you IV. Another trait that makes it dangerous is it does not break down quickly so the next day if you take the same dose or more like you would with other opiates you could be looking at an OD. You need to reduce the dose or not do it at all. Anyway I am sure to tell you all about it after. I have had my habit&nbsp; for over 20 years so my tolerance is quite high but i will be careful anyhow.<br />If anyone knows how I can make the powder smokable,&nbsp; I.E what do i need to add to make it run on the foil i would be very grateful.<br />Also for your info guys I have been getting opiates in pill form from jj70. A good vendor. Quick service and no FE.

				I&#039;m impressed again. I ordered from c63 at the weekend, we know he was absent until Tuesday, I think Pakchoi figured out it was a Dutch Bank Holiday. My order went to &quot;in transit&quot; at about 9:30am on Tuesday morning, I got the automated PM straight after, with a little note and question tailored for me, asking how I liked my first order from him, which was nice. Then this morning at 10:00am, (lazy postie today, usually get it earlier than that) that lovely envelope landed on my doormat. That is fast. I am so impressed, I didn&#039;t think it was possible for mail from The Netherlands could get to me in UK that quick. And, of course, absolute quality gear. No question, hands down, the best I&#039;ve ever had. I&#039;m so impressed by this vendor, my Dispater order took the same amount of time from being marked &quot;in transit&quot; to arriving here. I have no reason to go elsewhere in future. Providing I have enough cash! <br />SS, what is the rush like on those pills? Are they slow release?

				c63 wanted to know how much I liked his product, well, I&#039;m having to type this one-handed, (ha! I&#039;m not wanking, I don&#039;t like it that much!) I have no co-ordination.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I have one eye closed, the room is too bright for my sensitive eyes. It&#039;s taking me forever to type this message through trying not to make mistakes, and nodding. I open my eyes and realise I&#039;ve typed 6 rows of &quot;K&#039;s&quot;. Then I start deleting the rows of letters, start to nod again and start deleting parts of the good message, which, in turn, needs retyping. All good fun though, even though it&#039;s really pissing me off!<br />The only thing that I find is less than perfect with c63&#039;s package (the stealth is fantastic) is the &quot;bag&quot; it&#039;s in. We can&#039;t go into detail on this, but those of you who have ordered in the past will know what I mean. I lose quite a lot through transferring from the bag to a wrap, but hey-ho, you can&#039;t have everything. Right I&#039;m going to have a nod to Batman. Happy nods to all and to all a good nod. Peace. xx

				NAS. I have no veins so i can&#039;t tell you what the rush is like. 1 pill will hold off the sickness and if i smoke h on top i get a decent nod. and thats with micky mouse gear. I have to work so anything that keeps the sickness at bay is cool but I noticed that i don&#039;t crave h so much when taking them so they must be doing the job. In fact for the most part while at work i feel pretty good.<br /><br />Yes DT i will be careful, I have to try though especially after reading about that stuff. Did you know they put it on blotters.

				Hi, peeps! Everyone is still alright as i see, good :)<br />I myself after reading your comments on c63&#039;s ordered some from him yesterday and i myself started thinking of fent as alternative (got a reason for that). I did some research on different sites and forums and looked&nbsp; what&#039;s on sale on SR (spray, powder+lactose, patch/blotter) and it says the starting dose to opiod-tolerant people is 0.1 mg or smth like that and I know that IV is dangerous, but, to make the long story shorter,- can anyone give any comment - of the best way taking it and the best form to buy it in, please.<br />P.S. i smoked TN&#039;s - wasted all, hate smoking (thats why i don&#039;t like weed as well),- luckily i&#039;ve got&nbsp; some poor looking veins left yet&nbsp; :P<br />P.S.S. If somebody wants the topic to be renamed,- that&#039;s fine, but i remember some was saying&nbsp; smth like&quot;better not to, otherwise how we&#039;ll find each other&quot;<br />Edit: P.S.S.S. What do you think of jimmy boyle? Has anyone used them? In the accordance to what he says in his listing he&#039;s got the purest H in UK!

				hey all :D<br /><br />I think Dumpmanchronic was taking the pith ;)&nbsp; referring to the thread being nothing about TN maybe<br /><br />I think every dealer likes to think that they have the purest,best,strongest fattest bags but its down to these forums to weed out the bullshit and say it how it is.Until you get some your not going to know.However,different gear affects different people.Some like FM,some like TN.<br /><br />NAS,If your looking to smoke a #4 it cant be that good because im under the impression that a #4 should be so pure that you can only bump or I.V. it.Correct me if I&#039;m wrong but I personally wouldn&#039;t go for a #4 if the vendor said it was ok to smoke.You might be able to smoke an Afghan #4 though saying that! <br /><br />If I do order any #3 it will be from c63 from what everyone is saying but because I&#039;m still getting strong stuff inr,I might as well go for a good,white #4

				Hey guys, and girls ;)<br /><br />well yeah, I received c63 on Thursday and that&#039;s kept me busy till now. Good gear but not as good as it was 2 weeks ago. About 2/3 as strong and more dirty/harsh on the throat...<br /><br />ah what happened to the days of consistency, the same gear for months at a time?&nbsp; Maybe these dealers are going through SO much it changes every few weeks.... unthinkable how much they must sell cos my local dealer in the 90&#039;s used to get a fat brick and it would last for months, then he&#039;d go get another of the same quality...<br /><br />Anyway. I&#039;m off the gear for a while, as tempting as all this is, I am skint after a good month long run on the road and need to get my real life in order before I&#039;m off the rails again and all my hard work is for nothing... (TL;DR I&#039;ll be off the gear for a couple months)<br /><br />Hope everyone is good, had a wicked sunny weekend.<br /><br />Laters

				Soooo, to ease my descent back to earth, yesterday I bought a few items from the road. Some physeptone tablets from jimmyboyle (sent today) some pethidine from JJ70 (sent today) and some morphine MSTs from new vendor pure1 who messaged me after I placed the order to say he would post today 1st class but he hasn&#039;t according to the order page.<br /><br />Not a great way to make a first impression! I didn&#039;t spend much of course with pure1, just a sample.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update on the pethidine and MST if they show. I know JimmyBoyles pethidine tabs are AOK.<br /><br />

				Hello gang, I&#039;ve had no disposable income for the past 2 weeks, I haven&#039;t bought any gear so I was staying off the forum so as not to drive me too insane with desire and lust for sweet lady H. I have placed some orders today though, one of BO3&#039;s supposed better gear to try (and because he&#039;s notoriously quick with delivery) and a nice gram from my new fave, c63. I have to go out odd jobbing right now, will catch up later or Monday. Byesy bye. Oh, I&#039;ve landed a new job, for those who remember me say I was unemployed (very long time unemployed). Thing is, it&#039;s pretty specialist so I can&#039;t tell what it is in fear of my anonymity being lost. It&#039;s in a lab, I hope that will be sufficient info for you folk. Take care, and play nice kids. Speak soon

				Hello friends<br /><br />Has anyone had any luck with theXchange?<br /><br />I ordered half a gram from him over a week ago. When it failed to show in three days he replied promptly to my message, saying give it one more day and then he will reship. Since then the package has not arrived and he has stopped replying to me.<br /><br />Has anyone anything to say about this chap? I hope it turns out all right. He was initially very polite and forthcoming.<br /><br />I think I am going to give the Dutch gear a bash again. I shall order from Frank M today and see how that is this time. I really miss the outstanding quality of TopNotch, and can only hope he soon returns with his splendid Afghan.<br /><br />EDIT - Instead of Frank, I opted for a 2g order from Dr Holland. It&#039;s priced well and one or two people said it was good. Here&#039;s hoping it turns up! Also, he offers a free 0.1 of coke or H with every order.<br /><br />Best wishes to all. I have been away and so not posting.

It&#039;s up there with beston3&#039;s &quot;very good no joke&quot; gear though easily. His prices are really good as well, saying that I&#039;ve just looked at his page and he&#039;s put the prices up.

The problem I&#039;ve got is with the stealth. It was [REDACTED]. It just looked dodgy and I wouldn&#039;t want to order from him again until he addresses this issues. I have mentioned this in the feedback on his page.<br /><br />Could everyone please update with gear quality reports from new vendors when you get the chance, I&#039;d really like some new sources!<br /><br />Thanks all and happy nods!<br /><br /><br /><br />Please do not post detailed packaging and stealth information no matter how bad it was, it compromises security.<br /><br />ssbd

				Hi All, <br /><br />Well it seems that the fentanyl in my nasal spray had settled to the bottom because I took a spray last night and not only did i feel it in the membranes of my nose I got a massive rush and thought i might go over. In hindsight I should have shaken that bottle well before useing. I was quite impressed with the hit i got last night but it all seems a little unpredictable and a bit hit and miss. not sure if i would do it again. I might try smokin some next. Still eager to get&nbsp; some feedback on goldern horse.

				^^^I have and it was good, but it wasn&#039;t brown. The test is whether it dissolves in water without citric. It should dissolve in plain water to clear or light golden with very little heat. In fact its best not to heat it.

				Update on Jimmy Boyles ridiculously priced #3.<br /><br />Well at £180 a gram I was wanting miracles and it came close. Really strong and clean. Must be the purest stuff I have ever had. It felt like a shit ton of morphine, it was gouchy, it was buzzy, it was everything really.<br /><br />Just wish it wasn&#039;t so fricking expensive.<br /><br />To compare, I would rather buy TopNotch&#039;s best H than this, much better value for money. However, it is the best SR H I have tried.<br /><br />I have a feeling this may be better in the pin than on foil.<br /><br /><br />Would I buy again? Yes, but I would try c63amg again first as his good shit is better value.

For the same amount of money you would be getting more in weight and even though it is less strong, you would end up with more gear. If that makes sense.<br /><br />However last time I had c63, two weeks ago it was stepped all over.<br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t deny jimmy boyles stuff was GOOD shit and if you are pinning be very careful, but the price makes my teeth hurt!

				Defs sweetpoision, the worst thing is I had a full box of oxycontin (only 10mg tabs) that I eat over 2 days drinking last week thinking aww fuck it C63 is bound to have that sent by friday so should be arriving on monday but.... As it stands weeman the only reason I havnt cancelled is because I still have to wait an hour or something and on the whole I feel at this point I may as well give him a chance to reply to my message. In future if this happens I might just message a bit early or something. Has anyone else had any issues I wonder....? <br /><br />Has anyone dealt with Dr Holland whats his stealth, strength and delivery like in comparison with c63

				Thanks for the help. I have work in the morning anyway so Im going to log off here soon then see is there is any change either tomorrow before work or else after just depending on when I rise ill get back on at some point tomorrow night and let you know if I&#039;ve heard anything or even just to say that there has still been no word. I really want to hope that something out of the ordinary has happend that isnt to serious but has caused some delay but that he will get back to normal soon but who knows were not exactly in the most reliable end of buisness on a whole so could be anything, I still see some positive feedback coming through so I would like to think that I will get some kind of message back when he next logs on. Anyway untill tomorrow lets just keep d fingers crossed eh?

There is no information on the vendor&#039;s profile page. <br />He is online every day and some people&#039;s orders are processing since thursday. Say, if he ran out of H, then he could just take the H listings down and message people, but all listings are fine and active.&nbsp; Absolute ignorance.

Has anyone heard anything on what caused the delay? thanks for the info darktime i must get a browse but I wont be able to buy for a while I just load up every 2 weeks/ month depending on work and wether or not ive got the available cash for coins. Just a quick question what sites are you other UK heads using to get coins atm (im only asking out of curiosity)?

				Hi all,<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you know this but beston3 just told me he&#039;ll only be selling in 200mg bags from now on..<br /><br />No idea why.<br /><br />Also has anyone else tried Forever youngs gear? I did and found it to be better than beston3&#039;s &quot;very good no joke&quot; stuff.<br /><br />Oh and guess what happened to me today, I managed to drop a whole fucking bag of gear (1g of beston3&#039;s very good no joke stuff) somewhere when I was out so all of a sudden I&#039;m dry and just hoping a delivery arrives tomorrow :(<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				Hello all!<br /><br />Dabbler - what a miserable situation. I do hope it turns up for you. Let me know if you need a hand, as it were.<br />I do buy from Beston3 and he has not mentioned this new policy of his.<br /><br />Further, I would also be interested in ForeverYoung&#039;s product. Can anyone else confirm it is better than the &#039;no joke&#039; gear from Bo3? It would be nice to have another regular, quality supplier. Naturally I&#039;d like nothing better than to see the legendary TopNotch return, but in the interim let&#039;s keep on sharing that info on what is available.<br /><br />Finally, after a week in which I was a rather sick little bear - my order from theXchange did not show, my two grams from Dr Holland looked like they had vanished - my order from Dr Holland arrived and it is excellent. It took a week - but that&#039;s perhaps due to one postage stamp instead of the usual two from NL.<br /><br />Rather worryingly a corner of the envelope was also torn off. This would not be enough to inspect the contents due to the manner of packaging, but a smaller item would have easily been liberated through this hole. I&#039;ve informed the vendor - thanks to the packaging my order got to me - but were it not so difficult to extract from the envelope I&#039;m certain it would have been taken. <br /><br />Has anyone seen this before? Makes me a little reluctant to order again, frankly. Is this just a cheeky postman?<br /><br />Best wishes to all on what has turned out to be an excellent week for a formerly poorly little bear.<br />

				Just a bit of info that may help people that are clucking or waiting and forced into WD&#039;s<br /><br />This is an absolute godsend -<br /><br />Loperamide is one of the strongest opiates out there and you can buy it over the counter, it&#039;s as strong as fenatyl - however does not cross the BBB so you don&#039;t get a a buzz off it, but it completely removes all withdrawal symptoms as it binds to the other receptors in the body. <br /><br />It&#039;s the active ingredient in Imodium, but in any main supermarket you can buy the cheap own brand boxes for like 79p for 6 (2mg each).<br /><br />I&#039;ve had this little trick up my sleeve for a few years and for me it completely removes all withdrawal symptoms at a dose of 16-20mg (8-10 tablets as they have 2mg in each), for me. Other people need less, or some more - but IT WORKS. <br /><br />If you google about it there is a wealth of people that it&#039;s helped. Seems to work for most people, but not for the small minority.<br /><br />I once done a gram a day habit withdrawal using Loperamide only and felt fine all the way through.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d throw it out there for people that are not well and fancy getting well by simply going to the supermarket!&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace <br />J

				Hey, sorry to break in but who/what would you folk recommend to an opiate-naive newcomer?<br /><br />I smoked some standard BestOn3 gear awhile back, and couldn&#039;t help but feel like I fucked it up. I did it in 3 sessions of 100mg each, and only really felt anything substantial the final time. This leads me to believe I wasted most of it through poor tooting skills.<br /><br />Given I&#039;ll never inject, I&#039;m hoping to snort my next opiate as it&#039;s easier and your dose is more guaranteed. I also want to keep domestic. #4 H in the UK is rare and incredibly expensive. I was sold on SunWu&#039;s fentanyl/lactose powder until I read lots of people saying there&#039;s no euphoria with fentanyl - it&#039;s too &#039;clinical&#039; and boring. That defies the point for me.<br /><br />So that leaves crushed up morphine sulphate from MidnightCowboy / ByronLugosi / Pure1, codeine from UK1Hash or oxycodone from ByronLugosi. I&#039;m hoping I&#039;m wrong about the fentanyl - but if not I&#039;m leaning toward morphine or oxycodone.<br /><br />Am I right in thinking you can&#039;t snort #3? I can get about 300mg morphine sulphate for .5BTC vs. maybe 50-100mg oxycodone. Bang for buck the morphine is clearly the better deal?

				HI Jap, hope you are alright :)<br />As far as i know these diamorphine amps are 30 mg each,- how many do you do at a time? I mean how many to do (+/-) if you&#039;re opiate tolerant person?<br />Thanks<br />2 sharliecheen2 I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s possible to snort N3 as I IV it. But i had situations in my life when i couldn&#039;t find a vein and my syringe was full of blood and the solution wasn&#039;t injectable any more what i did was i dropped it under my tongue, not all of it straight away, just some drops every 10 seconds or so and it was fine. Also heard people plug it,- never tried myself but people say it&#039;s a good alternative. I myself tried smoking and never been successful in it,- wasted it every time.

				sharliecheen2 when your smoking #3 are you remebering to let the powder turn to an oil then make sure and tilt the foil so it can run it should start letting off a lot more smoke at this point, (if you dont let it run it can burn up all at once my guess is this happens because you are letting one piece of the foil get too warm but this is purely a guess anyway), inhale this through your toot (some people seem to reccomend a cardboard toilet roll holder for me this is far far too big as u suck in too much air, I use a rolled up piece of foil as it catches left over gear inside your toot which you can then smoke, but this takes a while to get right a decent enuff go to toot is a rolled up bank note some residue gathers on the inside of this over time which can be scraped off and smoked. If you search google youl find some useful info on smoking gear on drug-forum some of it is in reference to tar as it seems to be mostly US but the process sounds fairly similar). Just dont put out too much till you get the process right but when you do I think you will enjoy it, even the ritual brings a smile to my face now :D. <br /><br />Sorry im not much use when it comes to what is the more valuable option in terms of the morphine but im sure someone will be able to help. Dont know if any of the above will be of any use to you but im a dab hand at smoking it now (at least i think i am). Good luck

				After an order from c63 not turn up, and me sending many messages, I have just got a reply, 16 days later! I had to order from BO3 yesterday so I could feel right today. Whoever mentioned smoking BO3&#039;s cheap stuff, I doubt you did anything wrong. I IV&#039;d his cheap stuff, the first I&#039;d bought from him, and felt absolutely fudge all. I think it&#039;s the worst on the SR. I&#039;m waiting on a Dispater order now whilst hoping c63 sorts me out for the AWOL letter. I almost ordered from Frank Matthews today, but that goes against my policy of, don&#039;t order from Frank Matthews! No FE! No FE! No FE!<br />It still blows my mind to see in every feedback page, for every vendor&nbsp; &quot;FE for trusted seller&quot;, some people are just trying to get bum diddled.

				You can do what you like with #3 ,snort,smoke or IV...stick it up your ass if you like(that&#039;s always good)the only 2 things i suggest you don&#039;t do is eat it or when injecting,IM or skin pop as this is very painful and will probably lead to massive abscess&#039;s.<br />The guy who said he wasn&#039;t getting anything from smoking it,I would suggest trying another vendor.most of the uk vendors have shit ATM apart from that guy who does a gram for £180,which is outrageous but is supposed to be the nuts kit. <br />Even if you are not running it good you should get something of a 0.2g and BTW use foil tooters and only foil tooters.just wrap it round a pencil or whatever.after some time you&#039;ll learn how to get the most out of your toot.LOL at bog roll cardboard tube!!!<br />For the guy who said He will never use a pin.....yeah,ok..how many times have I heard that?!?!...sounds like me about 15 years ago.<br />as for sniffing MST...I pity your nose cos its gonna hurt and I dont think you&#039;ll get much of a buzz.try crushing up a 100mg mst and you&#039;ll know what im talking about.<br /><br />My best advice for newbie opiate users is to stop using right now!!before its too late.

From memory Fent is about 30x stronger than morphine and is commonly associated with clusters of overdose, usually resulting from fentanyl being sold as #4 heroin. It is short acting, meaning the buzz wears off in about an hour, and therefore encourages dependency. People describe it as &#039;heroin without a soul&#039;, if that makes sense - it does not have the euphoric effect peculiar to God&#039;s own medicine.<br /><br />If you are going to smoke heroin, here&#039;s a few tips:<br /><br />#1 Get the foil you are going to smoke from and pass a lighter up and down the dull side. This will help &#039;clean&#039; the foil. Make sure the foil is smooth before you apply the dope.<br />#2 Remember you are trying to heat, and not burn the dope. Place your little pile of powder on the foil, stroke the underside of the foil with the flame until it melts. When it has done so, you&#039;re ready to chase it.<br />#3 Pass the flame up and down the area containing the dope. &#039;Stroking&#039; it with the flame gives the right idea - you are trying to heat the dope and the foil in front of it, to cause it to run. <br />#4 Avoid keeping the flame stationary: this will toast your dope in one go. Tilt the foil in the direction you wish the dope to run.<br />#5 Keep the tooter close to the rear of the dope and be prepared to inhale shortly after you start heating it. It&#039;s a good idea to exhale before you go near it when the dope is still in powder form, as you can accidentally blow it into the carpet. Cue bitter tears.<br />#6 Learn how to make a proper tooter. There is a video on www.exchangesupplies.org which shows you how. The idea is to fold the foil in a certain way so as to preserve any residue for that rainy day which will certainly arrive. Remember to &#039;clean&#039; the foil beforehand, too.<br />#7 Give it a good ten minutes to feel any effects before you smoke again. People think you can&#039;t go over smoking heroin - and whilst it isn&#039;t easy to do so, it isn&#039;t impossible, especially for a person with low tolerance like yourself.<br />#8 I find it easier to move the foil rather than the tooter. Get used to doing two actions at once - perhaps do a &#039;dry run&#039; where you simply mimic the actions of &#039;stroking&#039; the foil with a lighter flame and moving the foil with the other hand. It sounds odd, but the action is a little unnatural and a bit of practice will probably help you get the most from your stash.<br />#9 Be aware that &#039;he who rides the tiger can never get off&#039;. This is the cautionary bit, where I condescend to you in the manner of a drawling, strung out if well meaning father figure. <br /><br />Personally I can manage my tolerance and pay for my habit. It is rather moreish and may turn out to be more than a dalliance. If you intend to &#039;chip&#039; - use recreationally and avoid dependency - then you might want to look at heroin helper. Google it - it&#039;s written by the chap who wrote the heroin user&#039;s handbook, and contains good tips on how to use whilst minimising the risk of dependency.<br /><br />I hope this helps. Do please stay away from fentanyl and happy tooting.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Now it&#039;s time to review. Having messaged Dr. Holland about it,&nbsp; I can now tell you about the product I got from him.<br /><br />Hours after ordering I got a message from Dr. Holland saying he had mistakenly sent me two grams of number four heroin, instead of the #3 I ordered. He asked whether this was acceptable, which I thought very decent of him. Naturally I was happy and told him so.<br /><br />After a rather difficult week, the package arrived. The bag contained a light yellow powder with many granules and larger clusters, similar in colour and appearance to cornflour. It most certainly is not. Unless you wish to murder your dinner guests I would advise against adding this to your gravy.<br /><br />Dr Holland informs me that he will soon be listing his #4, and that is a very good thing. In my, uh, &#039;career&#039;, I have had pharmaceutical heroin, morphine ampoules, MST, and the usual array of street opiates. I have never experienced such a powerful rush and durable effect from any opiate other than the good doctor&#039;s #4.<br /><br />When he does list this, I suggest you buy it. Be very careful, as if I had taken my usual dose I would certainly be dead. It is very potent indeed and the man is prompt, considerate and well mannered to a fault.<br /><br />I can&#039;t recommend Dr Holland enough. I waited for him to confirm that my reviewing an unlisted &#039;mistake&#039; item was acceptable, so here it is. <br /><br />Right, that is quite enough thread-hogging from me. Time for a stroll. Best wishes to you all and I hope this proves helpful.

				Posted this on a seperate post, my first 3 weeks on SR but I think some of the guys in this thread may find it useful, atleast the vendor reviews....<br /><br />hey guys just started using sr for last few weeks, mainly treating myself to a little splurge on heroin...<br /><br />last time I had used h before this was over a year ago but I had smoked a bunch of oxys at one point and had to go thru some pretty bad withdrawals just about 10 months ago but only ever smoked the h...<br /><br />Leaving uk for the states in a few days for some fun in the sun but no drugs, besides weed and occasional xanax<br /><br />As we speak I&#039;m experiencing some mild to moderate withdrawals but I am using a combo of otc codeine/nurofen pills and lots of weed and feel ok, wish these xanax I bought on here were working but they suck, which will lead me to my first vendor review...<br /><br />Chillzon3too-<br />This is the guy I got the C10 3.5 mg xanax from, I bought 20 for half a coin... was excited by the 3.5 dosage... first let me say the guy is not a scammer, I rated him 5/5 and would recommend him to other noobs... He had great reviews, but anyway this batch that he received were apparently no good, anyway good communications and full refund, didnt require fe and just canceled my order after I had already received the product... So sum it up would try him again<br /><br />fromonetoanother-<br />Bitcoin seller for uk on here, deposited £ straight into local bank acct, no name given nor needed by either party and always came thru perfect and expediently. definitely would recommend... Let me also write as a warning to other noobs and I&#039;ve already posted this when it happened to me, my first btc deposit was instantly stolen, I was tricked into a stupid phishing version of sr from a link that popped up on google. I admit now I&#039;m an idiot for falling for it and I entered my pin. Made a new acct and the vendor even agreed to sell me half his minimum purchase due to what happened just bc I was nervous about the first issue....<br /><br />Heroin- only used 2 vendors<br />I myself am not much of a user tbh, I like to go thru 2 week splurges like once a year but keep it strictly to smoking and try not to use more than 2 days without a 2 day break. I&#039;ve prob never used the premium pulp fiction gear in my life and never IV only smoke, snorted once in amsterdam. Cant become an addict it would just ruin my life so this is what works best for me to manage my life and my &quot;demons&quot;<br /><br />dispater-<br />Used him 4 times, I personally like his gear, way better than street and always lasted me a while, 1g lasted me from saturday afternoon till tuesday late night. Had to fe with him but was willing to risk on $40 or so purchase for half g first couple times. First couple orders were processed super quick and arrived next day on midday purchases. Last couple were kind of annoying and took like 24hours to show in transit but still arrived withing about 48hrs or 2 mail days. Def recommend<br /><br />theXchange-<br />Solid vendor. Instant responses and super fast shipping, stealth far more advanced than dispater, his gear is cheap and still good but slightly below dispaters for my personal taste on the foil but its also a descent amount cheaper and turnaround and comms were way quicker... def recommend also didnt have to fe which is nice<br /><br /><br /><br />sk0rt-<br />bought 10mg valium off him, blue ones by auprin, they were legit and did the trick for me, comms and turnaround two thumbs up. Didnt have to fe, only problem he&#039;s been out of stock ever since, would def recommend if he comes back. Stealth was descent.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ByronLugosi-<br />Just ordered a few subutex from him, didnt have to fe, hoping to receive tomoz, comms were great and he even added a free shipping option when I messaged him about the .08 btc shipping charge on a .15btc purchase. So far excellent and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll receive tomorrow or friday....<br /><br />Also did a few lotto purchases, didn&#039;t bink anything...<br /><br />Overall so far I have to agree with this chick I know who I showed the site to &quot;this is definitely one of the coolest things I&#039;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; I&#039;m personally surprised by how easy it is to send packages domestically uk-uk with royal mail. Overnight service from her majesty!<br /><br />Gonna take a&nbsp; break now from anything heavy, florida hurricanes and humidity with a bit of sun and women, probably a lot more booze and xanax in my near future. Hope some newby uk members find this useful

I think it would be hard to make it work with meth. what ml are you on. I do know that as it can&#039;t cross the BBB it works on opiate receptors in the GUT. If you take it with white or pink Grapefruit juice that will help the&nbsp; Loperamide cross the BBB. For those on methadone you will need all the help you can get to cross the BBB. If you look Loperamide and graopefruit juice and you did not have a habbit you would get stoned. Please not if you are on Blood preasure pills or other medication then you must check if its safe to consume grapefruit juice. If certain drugs cross the bbb or the bbb lets to much of that drug in you could od. I know its mad but check out grapefruit and the effect it has on helping some drugs get to your brain.

				Good to hear there&#039;s going to be another #4 option soon. Thanks for the review AgentLee. Am looking forward to trying that. Usually I order from FrankMatthews but the last batch of #4 I had from him was yellow and sticky and, as I&#039;m a snorter, difficult to use. Still, Frank is pretty reliable in my book and although he does ask you to FE he still sends the product when he messages you to finalise - in my experience anyway.<br /><br />By the way, I would advise anyone NOT to order SuperTrips #4. I have no idea what the fuck it is but it sure as hell isn&#039;t heroin. Someone else on here reckons it was some sort of weird fentanyl analog.

I thought that was meant to be H he bought by mistake from FM. I have to say maybe his sales were down and he was short of cash. Its very easy to sell to junkies ( Don&#039;t take that the wrong way, I would call myself a junkie all day long. I love Junk) especially if you offer a deal on some gear. I feel for you, there is nothing worse than coming up when you are strung out or need to get stoned. Also Pharmaboy has no active listings. Lastly did he not say that he bought it by mistake off FM. I have bought off FM a number of times and he has always been spot on. I for one will not buy anything off Pharma until you get a decent explanation. Even then i would need to think 3 x

Other people need less, or some more - but IT WORKS. <br /><br />If you google about it there is a wealth of people that it&#039;s helped. Seems to work for most people, but not for the small minority.<br /><br />I once done a gram a day habit withdrawal using Loperamide only and felt fine all the way through.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d throw it out there for people that are not well and fancy getting well by simply going to the supermarket!&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace <br />J<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />mate that&#039;s fantastic i have a mate who is desperate to give up. this will really help.

I think it would be hard to make it work with meth. what ml are you on. I do know that as it can&#039;t cross the BBB it works on opiate receptors in the GUT. If you take it with white or pink Grapefruit juice that will help the&nbsp; Loperamide cross the BBB. For those on methadone you will need all the help you can get to cross the BBB. If you look Loperamide and graopefruit juice and you did not have a habbit you would get stoned. Please not if you are on Blood preasure pills or other medication then you must check if its safe to consume grapefruit juice. If certain drugs cross the bbb or the bbb lets to much of that drug in you could od. I know its mad but check out grapefruit and the effect it has on helping some drugs get to your brain.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It does work with meth - you just need a lot more pills to hold the W/D&#039;s off.<br /><br />Grapefruit juice WILL NOT help it cross the BBB. Loperamide is kept from crossing the BBB via P-glycoprotein(PGP) and grapefruit juice won&#039;t do shit - although grapefruit juice is an opiate potentiator, quite useful to get max effects if you have a shit bit of gear.<br /><br />The only real research that shows how to make lopermide cross the BBB is to do with Quinidine as it is a p-glycoprotein inhibitor - however the research is very much non-conclusive.<br /><br />Tonic water contains quinine which is a weaker version of Quinidine, so if you drink a few litre&#039;s of tonic water before taking Lopermide you may have a slim chance of some crossing the BBB.<br /><br />But in all honesty - it doesn&#039;t have to cross the BBB to relieve W/D&#039;s. People have been trying to get lopermide to cross the BBB for years now, and there still isn&#039;t any concrete evidence it can. Although snippets here and there suggest it can. Also as soon as it becomes abusable in that way it won&#039;t be an OTC drug. <br /><br />The whole point of my original post though was not so people can start getting off their tits on Imodium, but simply to use it as a tool to get clean, or use it on days where they can&#039;t score.<br /><br />But trust me grapefruit juice is a waste of time with lopermide - all grapefruit juice can do is potentiate opiates, but there are far better potentiaters out there than G juice anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Your have to let me know if you ever order with a reminder ; )<br /><br />But yeah.. in all honesty im very surprised more opiate lovers / addicts / do not use it as it can provide me (and many others) with a great buzz.. also the tea lasts for a stupidly long time.. id love to know why.. but drink a decent size brew at 10am and your be seen through till evening which is a great advantage compared to other stuff as we all know ; ) <br /><br />You got the method spot on there. Thats really all there is too it.. just add water that has already been boiled to the pod powder (I say about 2 cups per 10g&#039;s roughly) for strength then I say if you have heavy opiate tolerance than try 15g and work up from there.. some people buzz off 5gs but i personally would need a lot more. Also when brewing if you add some lemon juice when you add the water it helps with the extraction of the morphine / codeine etc and if you can handle drinking the tea cold (ish) then i would leave it for as long as you can and stir from time to time as I beleive (again just a personal thing) this produces a stronger high.. when you strain the tea just use a household civ, nice n easy ; )<br /><br />The slush can indeed be used after its initial use.. I&#039;d say up to 4 times but probavbly no more. Now this is a GREAT way to get the most out of your money and drugs and is surprisingly effective.. I put this on my vendor page but I guarantee 90% or so of the people that buy the tea from me dont do it!! <br /><br />OPIUM TEA DRINKERS RE-BREW YOUR LIQUID IT WILL SAVE YOU A QUICK QUID&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />OT

Your have to let me know if you ever order with a reminder ; )<br /><br />But yeah.. in all honesty im very surprised more opiate lovers / addicts / do not use it as it can provide me (and many others) with a great buzz.. also the tea lasts for a stupidly long time.. id love to know why.. but drink a decent size brew at 10am and your be seen through till evening which is a great advantage compared to other stuff as we all know ; ) <br /><br />You got the method spot on there. Thats really all there is too it.. just add water that has already been boiled to the pod powder (I say about 2 cups per 10g&#039;s roughly) for strength then I say if you have heavy opiate tolerance than try 15g and work up from there.. some people buzz off 5gs but i personally would need a lot more. Also when brewing if you add some lemon juice when you add the water it helps with the extraction of the morphine / codeine etc and if you can handle drinking the tea cold (ish) then i would leave it for as long as you can and stir from time to time as I beleive (again just a personal thing) this produces a stronger high.. when you strain the tea just use a household civ, nice n easy ; )<br /><br />The slush can indeed be used after its initial use.. I&#039;d say up to 4 times but probavbly no more. Now this is a GREAT way to get the most out of your money and drugs and is surprisingly effective.. I put this on my vendor page but I guarantee 90% or so of the people that buy the tea from me dont do it!! <br /><br />OPIUM TEA DRINKERS RE-BREW YOUR LIQUID IT WILL SAVE YOU A QUICK QUID&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />OT<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m gonna buy some right this second - you&#039;ve just sold it to me with that, I trust you and take your word bro&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thanks mate.

If you&#039;re a junkie you want consistency and reliability from your dealer above all, right? Fuck scoring IRL when you&#039;ve got that at your fingertips.

				Ok guys n dolls, listen up and listen up good&nbsp; :D<br /><br />There is pretty much only 1 guy on the block right now that does the business in the UK !<br />The product is excellent, just got a taste of a his new batch of H which knocked me clean on my arse (so be careful with it !)<br />Anyways, back to this seller, the guy seems to have super human powers, place an order in the morning and its dispatched 1st post, get your order in before 3pm and I dunno how he does it, but the order gets through my letter box in less than 24hrs !!! (Every time I tell ya, every fucking time !!!)<br />The packaging is low noise stealth, vacuum packed and ALWAYS bang on or even (like me today) overweight !!!<br />What more does a buyer need that a seller he can rely on and more to the point gear he can rely on?<br />So who is this mysterious figure you ask ?<br /><br />Well I will tell ya....His name is Dispater !!!!<br /><br />I can&#039;t recommend this guy highly enough people.<br />I&#039;ve been lucky enough to do business with Dispator since I first started using SR and he has come through every time.<br />Without a doubt THE best and most reliable UK seller on SR bar none.<br /><br />Sorry for sounding like a kiss ass but this guy deserves the credit.<br />Good luck to him !!<br />

				So I wanna leave a quick short review for my main UK to Uk Heroin #3 vendor. Of course I&#039;m talking about : dispater =)<br /><br />Out of a good 15+ orders from him since he has first started, all for heroin, I can honestly say that he is simply magnificent! The guy has always produced way above street level gear for a price that can&#039;t be matched by other UK to UK vendors. The value for money is just astounding!<br />Quality has always been consistent as well as quantity and each time I receive one of his nice big fat chunky rocks of gear, it makes me wanna JIZZ IN MY PANTS!<br /><br />Shipping is always under 24 hours which is what makes his service unbeatable compared to others. It&#039;s faster for me to buy gear off of him compared to buying it on the street! In fact I don&#039;t ever PM the guy. I just place the order, wait half a day and then wake up to a nice lovely package with my name on it waiting for me at the door the very next morning! It&#039;s like Christmas for me at least 3 times a week hahahaha =)<br /><br />His communication is excellent. If I do ever PM him, he gets back to me within a day which is a lot more than I could say compared to other vendors who are just as busy, yet only reply once every couple days!<br />Packaging is perfect as always for domestic orders. Very secure and quite simple too.<br /><br />So all in all dispater is the most professional, organized and extremely generous vendor here at the road for the best UK to UK Gear! I&#039;m chasing a nice fat rock of heroin on foil at the moment, my eyes are so pinned I&#039;m surprised I even managed to type this well! Gear always runs so smooth, tastes so good and feels so clean! Has some great legs too and keeps me high all day!!!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thanks man, keep it up! I&#039;ll always be back for more...<br /><br />

				My experience with Dispater -<br /><br />I had a couple of questions for him about his heroin which he replied to within a couple of hours, politely and intelligently. So I decided to place an order for 0.5g.<br /><br />I finalized early due to this being only my 9th transaction, though I did it with confidence after having dealt with him before. The order was quickly processed and arrived the next morning.<br /><br />The product was put in a baggy then vacuum packed and the package was inconspicuous. I weighed the two little rocks at 0.6g. The quality was excellent for the price.<br /><br />From now on I won&#039;t look further than Dispater for my coke or heroin. Professional service &amp; great communication. <br /><br />Long live SR!

But as I have many years experience I put the foil away enjoyed it. Then a few hours later finished off what was on the foil. A half gram lasted 2 full days which is very impressive. Recommended!<br /><br />The comms, packaging and next day delivery (UK-UK) has made Dispater the vendor to go to for me. I just need to stop myself from buying it on a regular basis. Though I do have several hundred Subutex stashed away... hmm ;)

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have used Dispaters services many times over the past few months, buying my Coke and Gear off him.<br />The service is second to none, the product is nearly always with me within 24hrs, and the few that have not made it in 24hrs have been with me in 48hrs.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; His packages are always vac sealed and blend in with the regular mail, very professional.<br />My most recent buy, half a G of both Brown &amp; Coke.<br />The Gear was really very good. Over the past few years I noticed that a lot of UK street gear and some of the SR gear &#039;Runs&#039; with a &#039;Red&#039; tinge which I do not like it seems to indicate that the H is not very strong, I&#039;m not sure what it is but I guess it must be some sort of &#039;Cut&#039;.<br />Dispaters H does NOT run with a &#039;Red&#039; tinge. It comes in Rocks and is always a little over, which is great. It runs lovely on the Foil and tastes of Poppies, which for me, is a really good sign. <br />I have tried all the UK vendors and apart from one other vendor Dispaters is the BEST!! The other vendors gear may be a bit stronger but it is more than 3 times the price of Dispaters. I choose Dispaters, I have a habit and value is really important to me. Dispaters H is the best value I <br />have found on Silk Road.<br />The Gear is fast acting and I don&#039;t have to smoke a whole half G to get a buzz. The feeling is a proper old skool No3, very euphoric and makes me talkative with a lovely sense of&nbsp; well being. My tolerance is quite high and I take Subutex most days, but Dispaters Gear &#039;breaks&#039; through the Subbies within a few lines, which is something a lot of the H on SR does not do. <br />I will be continuing to buy Dispaters Heroin, &amp; if you like clean No3 that is excellent value for money, supplied with a near faultless service, I suggest, you give it a try.<br />C

				dispater asked me to write a review on this thread,<br />I have ten orders through dis over the last month and 9/10 landed the next day. The packaging was great with the product in a sealed vac bag. As for product the H has been of good quality - i seemed to have had two different batches with the lighter one possible a touch stronger, no idea how it goes on the foil cos that aint my thing but in the spoon it cooks clear. I wont score it out of ten cos i think everyone has there own scoring method but for me a 15 yr user it was plenty strong enough and cheaper than some SR vendors. I tried two other vendors but I&#039;m a Dispater fan for now, hope this continues for a long time.

				Lets get one thing straight, Dispater&#039;s gear has arrived once next day, every other time it&#039;s taken 2 UK to UK, and the quality is better than BO3&#039;s cheap stuff, nowhere near the quality of c63. The high from dispater&#039;s gear is a creeper and not very strong. I don&#039;t believe that these reviewers have much experience, or they&#039;re fake accounts

				I was under the impression that supertrips were the mutt&#039;s nuts. Oh well, I use BitBargain Zazoo, Using Bitstamp via Transferewise was taking days, and Bitstamp&#039;s site was down too much. What method do you normally use?

				RE: Dispater...<br /><br />Dispater was the first person i ordered from on SR, and he has helped me all the way. Understandably, he is sometimes busy, but he has ALWAYS replied to my PM&#039;s within a few hours and my 3 items ive had off him ALL arrived next day. <br />(i guess im just a lucky S.O.B lol)<br /><br />RE: Stealth: 5/5 Im not going to reveal the stealth, but rest assured you dont know whats in the package until you open it. This is perfect stealth for UK-UK. <br /><br />Like ive read previously, ive also had 2 different batches so far off dis, one lighter, one darker, and the lighter one was stronger, and cleaner cooking in the spoon, although the darker one was still better than street level gear round my way.(ive been an IV user for 6months, Smoker for 10years previous, and on a 60ml a day methadone script)<br /><br />I have ordered H off another vendor as well. (UK-UK)&nbsp; He accepted my order within MINUTES and sent me a message to say it was in the post....This was 3hours before dis accepted mine, but his arrived and the other didnt. (it could be due to the distance from where i am, to them) THIS IS NOT A MESSAGE TO PUT THE OTHER VENDOR DOWN, IM JUST RELAYING MY EXPERIENCES, (gear was good too, it just took a day longer to get to me lol)<br /><br />Sorry for typing a novel for you all to read, but being a newbie to the forums, i wanted to put some detail into my review, as some people don&#039;t trust newbies reviews (as said previously in this thread)<br /><br />In conclusion, thanks Dispater for making my first, second and third journey along the road a happy one (although most of my clothes now have burn-holes and dribble-marks on!)<br /><br />Thanks, and i&#039;ll be ordering again on thursday...<br /><br />

Still don&#039;t know what to think so i will be eagerly waiting for your review. Don&#039;t forget to burn some on the foil.

Lets hope.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve never tried his gear before - so I wont base my review on previous reviews etc. It will be a honest review of the current batch he has in. To be fair he has a rating of 100 and really good feedback - If people on this thread have tried his gear and thought it was shit, why have they left positive 5/5 feedback? Seems odd - I leave honest feedback, I don&#039;t aim to please the vendor by giving 5/5 if it&#039;s not worthy of that.<br /><br />To be honest I have high hopes from this current batch - someone I know on here and in real life, said he thought the current batch was very good (much better than street gear) - we shall see, but one things for sure It&#039;ll be honest.<br /><br />And although I don&#039;t smoke it on the foil - I will do before I have a hit, just to let you guys know what it runs like etc.

				Someone above talked about fake reviews - i don&#039;t think there is a need for that.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t too many&nbsp; H vendors on here from the UK - and I&#039;m sure folk with bad experiences do post them.<br />Topnotch and Dispater gear about the same for me - better than local street but not as good as FrankMathews #3 (&nbsp; I prefer FM#4 of course but waiting for international orders messes my head up too much&nbsp; - someone else noticed that the postie seems to turn into &#039;the man&#039; when he&#039;s got something for us in that we always gotta wait).<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve been ordering from Dispater ever since TN made a mistake with one order - genuine mistake which then had further delays in comms due to site problems.&nbsp; I&#039;d have no problem ordering from TN again but have no reason to as Dispater&#039;s Dispatch is second to none, I&#039;ve ordered after 5pm and still got next day delivery.&nbsp; Gear is good, double smellproof wrap with quality stealth.&nbsp; Comms have been good - had no issues to discuss except once when i forgot to finalise (actually had a timeout and then forgot to go back to do it again) and then he was polite about reminding me so it didn&#039;t get as far as auto-finalise which would have looked bad for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a couple of lower priced options but i get put off those as there is always talk of delays etc in the fb.&nbsp; Dispater has 100% rating and you don&#039;t get that without making the effort to get it right.&nbsp; <br /><br />jm2c

				THIS IS NOT DISPATERS PERSONAL THREAD.STOP POSTING REVIEWS HERE YOUR TAKING UP SPACE.!!!<br /><br />I know exactly what his gear is like and all these newbie posts looks like a desperate bid to get sales.<br /><br />Hi gang btw.Ive been Ill since friday so havnt been online.I hope your all doing well.<br />Ive had to stay clear of the opiates as well cos I have a test on saturday and need to be clean.<br />Benn doing a lot of jelly marzis recently,they are fucking lovely.Amsterdamdrugs is a great vendor for them.He takes time to read and answer any questions you have and will make sure that you are sorted.<br />Talk soon folks :D<br />P.S.<br />who&#039;s the OP of this thread?Is it NAS ? whoever s it is can you message dispater and tell him to take the link down because this isnt a review thread just for him.If he wants one he can make one himself.I believe that most of those posts are fake accounts but some must be real.Its funny how they all sound the same and considering that some of them say they have ordered from him 15+ times or Ive been with dispater from the start,that they have newbie forum accounts!!

				Hi, pak<br />c63 quality/service/etc. seems alright now,- my last order with him was really good stuff,- strong and overweight (it was only 1 day delay).<br />BO3&#039;s, dispater&#039;s is very weak, especially for us,- people on this thread - with big toler to opiates.<br />JB&#039;s - is very expensive, and you said though it&#039;s really good H,- it&#039;s better value to buy from c63.<br />We&#039;ll see how FM&#039;s&nbsp; N4 is when it arrives.

				i got from c63 on thursday last week , usual 2 day delivery , once put in transit and as sweetpoison said it was only one day delay last week . <br />the quality was spot on the wife and i both really liked it . his #3 is back to being good again , was a bit worried as a few weeks before the quality went right down hill , but as i said its back to the good stuff <br />i also put an order in for #3 from dr holland and i promised to leave a review for it , but i am still waiting to get it i put in the order on monday last week put in transit tuesday the same time as c63 , i have read that he only puts the one stamp on it so it can take over a week , which is bang out of order as we are paying £6 for postage . you would think he would want us to get it soon as possible so we can finalize and he gets his money ?? his ratting has also fell from 100% to 90% , but when i look at the feedback its all 5/5 does not make sense. is anyone else waiting on an order from dr holland ?<br /><br />

				i promised frank matthews i would post on the forums , updating my review for his #3 <br />2 weeks ago i got 3.5g #3 from frank , and to be honest it was garbage , terrible nothing like the quality i had been getting from him , i was really pissed off about it , i put a few comments on the forum about it pluss starting a thread about the quality of franks #3 . that day his account was suspended for something else . <br />i thought that was it my money lost as i had fe&#039;d. <br />when his account went back up i messaged frank to tell him about it , and by this time he had got a new batch of #3 in .&nbsp; and fair play to the guy he got back to me asking if i wanted a reship of the new stuff . <br />a few days past , i thought he was going to make out he had sent it but really he had not . then yesterday i got a little surprise in the post . <br />hats off to the guy he sent it , and lets face it he didnt need to bother i dont think my review would have made much difference to his sales , but that tells me he is a very good vendor , a straight up honest guy , that wants to help his buyers sort any problems out . i have bought from frank now over 15 times always received my order , in good time, 2 days normally . and this has only reassured me that frank can be trusted

				I got my order from dispater, yet to try it as I&#039;m still getting through some previous gear.<br /><br />I must say that he sent it at 6:30 and I received it the next day, and it weighed .73 and I only ordered .5<br /><br />I will try it tomorrow as I&#039;ll be out of my current stock by then and leave a review. <br /><br />I did quickly put a bit on the foil and it runs pretty well and I got a little buzz, nothing special but I definitely felt it.

				i too got my order from dr holland today , he had put two stamps on it . <br />thats a few people that got from dr today , he must have sent them all on monday , which for me is not so good since he said it was posted last tuesday ? but at least i got it today .<br />the #3 is right good stuff , would say its better than franks and a bit better than c63 . it runs nice on the foil , clean and its got a very good taste . well worth the money . <br />i messaged the dr yesterday to say to him about waiting , he got back within a couple of hours saying on my next order he would make it up to me . <br />i will defo order from him again cause it seems he has got the postage sorted out

Don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s not bad - and for the price and the extra I got I&#039;m happy with the purchase. I doubt I would buy any more from dispater though as there is much better gear about then theirs.<br /><br />Overall, I&#039;m pleased as I got .73 for 0.59BTC - but I wouldn&#039;t recommend his gear. It&#039;s handy if you need next day and are desperate, because you WILL get it next day.<br /><br />The gear itself isn&#039;t too bad and better than most street gear, but on SR there is much better quality about. Put it this way, I wouldn&#039;t be able to type properly if it was top quality gear. I&#039;m typing with one eye closed and I did get a gouch off the hit, but it was quite a big hit<br /><br />I&#039;d give it a 7/10. <br /><br />I gave a 5/5 rating on his page, and I intend to leave it at that - purely for the rapid delivery, great comms, and the fact it was so over weight. If it wasn&#039;t these things I would edit it and give it a 3 or 4 out of 5.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks Japan,<br /><br />I thought as much. Either the posts on here raving about his gear are from users without much tolerance or knowledge of proper H or they are made up as someone else said. I almost went and ordered. Glad i did not. I personally would rather pay extra for quality without exception. Cheers for the review.

				Great news about Dr Holland tho guys.&nbsp; Glad his posting is sorted and hopefully the ratngs will improve.&nbsp; How is the stealth? I am usually happy with c63 with hsi quality, stealth and free shipping it is only a bit more money which I&#039;m usually happy to pay.&nbsp; However may try the good DR on the next run.

				I bought some ground poppy pods to make opium tea from the vendor called opium tea!<br /><br />Brewed some up and it&#039;s lovely - gives you a nice glowing opium buzz. Definitely recommend this to people, I&#039;ve actually just placed another order of it even though I still have plenty left of the first order.<br /><br />First time I&#039;ve tried poppy pod tea, and I&#039;m very impressed by it.<br /><br />Cheap as well for 30 grams of the stuff - highly recommended&nbsp; 8)

This time I had messaged him to ask for the Gear to be put in a wrap before he put it in his little plastic sealed bags. He had not done this, when I opened the letter the gear was stuck to paper and the bag had burst, most of the gear stuck to the glue from the sticker &amp; it was impossible to get the gear &amp; there was dust all over the paper, Gutted!! I tried to scrape as much as I could up, but I must of got a bit of glue or paper in it and when I tried to smoke it, it just frazzled. I have sent him a message &amp; I have not finalized yet. What is the best thing to do, please, I&#039;d be grateful for any advice. Somebody else had already moaned about his bags, and my last order, even though it was way over was in a huge bag with loads stuck to the bag and little &#039;puffs&#039; of dust when you moved the &#039;sealed&#039; bag.

A photo would help in resolution, but it&#039;s not vital.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t finalise, even if they say they&#039;ll reship - wait till the reship arrives then finalise.<br /><br />Hope that helps a little bit.....The main thing is to not finalise. They may say &#039;finalise and we&#039;ll send a reship&#039; so many people have fallen for that as you&#039;ll probably not get the reship as it wont be sent.<br /><br />I would be gutted, I hope things work out for you man&nbsp; 8)

				<br />&nbsp;Thank you all very much for the advice &amp; kind words. I have taken photo&#039;s, I&#039;m not so pissed off now the subbies are working a bit.<br />I will wait for his reply. Thanks again.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting on some from C63 so I should be fine soon, but I had the order with Fy to fill the gap, so to speak. <br />I have only tried Franks gear from Holland so far, &amp; it&#039;s in a different ball park to most of the UK gear, proper gear and the 0.2 was&nbsp; well over.<br />So I&#039;m really looking forward to C63&#039;s, &amp; now the sooner the better.<br />C

				I posted that dispater&#039;s current batch didn&#039;t seem to bad on the foil - and I don&#039;t usually smoke my gear, but it seemed quite nice.<br /><br />But then I had my usual amount in a hit and was slightly disappointied, don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s not too bad, but I was expecting it to be better. But the weight of it and how quickly it got delivered made up for that I suppose. He&#039;s definitely worth a punt if times running out and you don&#039;t wanna be sick the following day.

I have used a lot of vendors and generally speaking I found c63 number 3 to be better than franks but not by too much. Ive never tried number 4 as im shite at waiting for a drug to kick in so I would definitely be a prime candidate to re-dose thinking what i had was shit and then OD. Just as a heads up I got 2.5 of c63 no 3 current batch last friday and I have to say I was very happy nice strong buzz and plenty of light nods done, my only issue is that it was too good as I intended trying to make the 2.5 stretch a bit more than usual and yet wednesday night I ran out now for an anxious wait to put some money a side and re-order.<br /><br />Just wondering has any of you ever tried the 10mg tablets of oxycontin??? I can get these fairly easily and often just eat them BUT i was wondering if there is anyway to smoke them I have tried before but didnt have too much success and I am convinced Im just wasting my shit?<br /><br />And im really glad to hear of dispater stuff imroving just incase there any delays on the dutch stuff in future a wee .5 too keep u going while you wait would be nice<br /><br />thanks for any help its great to see people having a laugh and generally help each other out as it proper casts aside the image the media places on &quot;junkies&quot; particularly if opiates are your thing.

				Hi peeps<br />Like i said i ordered from FM cuz wanted to try his N4.<br />He sent me a message today asking to FE so he can send it, but i &#039;ve come home late at night. I wanted to ask those who had business with him,- Does it mean he hasn&#039;t sent it today? Or he sends it anyway , just asks to FE. I&#039;m pretty positive i read somewhere on the forum smb was saying that he sends it anyway. May be i misunderstood.<br />&nbsp;OpiumTea ordered from him,- hope he&#039;ll reply as well<br />Thanks<br />P.S. My order with FM was processing for about 48 hours to start of and then when he put it into transit with asking me to FE i was at work all day and came back late at night,- so that&#039;s another day wasted. So, what i want to say- i don&#039;t know how good/bad his gear is but it&#039;s not a fast process! C63 is the best H vendor on the road at the moment! To my opinion

With using every night the 2.5 grams tends to last a week maybe 10 days. Along side this I eat the oxy every few other month for a day or 2. <br /><br />I was wondering what you opinion is on my question about my oxy use. Y do you think I barely get any buzz from taking 14 10mg tabs in 2 doses with a 3 hour gap? Do you think its down to tolerance or is taking multipile 10mg pills not as good as taking 1 70 or higher tablet? Thanks for all the responses so far I hope Im not being annoying. If I figure out how to give you some Karma points I will defs be throwing some your way I cant believe I never noticed the quote button (massive face alm moment right there haha)

				Got my dutch packages today (and I have a day off work, how perfect&nbsp; ;))<br /><br />So.. FM no4.. good packaging (same as normal) Now the gear.. Ive been sniffing / smoking UK stuff for last week or two.. WOW, I love holland lol 8) so yeah its lovely. I remember reading just now someone who posted sayin they smoke all day chasing that buzz you get from dutch stuff. I almost forget the buzz I get from the dutch stuff untill I use again.. Im there now though! I have a question though.. the no4 is very bitty (as normal) but im finding it really hard to break down into fine eoungh powder to sniff.. any help would be muchly appreciated?<br /><br />C63.. packaging is still (and will prob always be) the best I have seen both on and off the road so fairshout to that brother.. The gear.. again WOW, I love the texture, so smooth&nbsp; 8) smells lush and gives &#039;that&#039; buzz we all know so well.. <br /><br />i struggle to really write up a proper review as so hard to explain how you feel off something aint it?! But anyway.. really pleased with both and will order again this weekend so I get some before I run out (meaning no uk stuff hopefully!)<br /><br />OT

				&nbsp;acetic anhydride or anhydritis is a chemical which is used to do diacetilation, basicly,- turn morphine into diamorphine. I&#039;ve never seen N4 so dark. looks like N3 to me by its colour. The only thing you can do is just do small portions every so many minutes (10-20) if you&#039;re scared to OD to see what is your dose of this stuff, let us know how you do with it!<br />Oh really? you got your order after 24 hour? Are you from UK or not?<br />I&#039;m in the UK, normally it takes 48 hours for his packages to arrive to me, but this time it&#039;s longer,- i placed my order on tuesday night, it was marked in transit on wednesday.

				Oh sorry, I thought you meant my current order. My last order from him was place on Wednesday night and marked in transit thursday, received Monday. Normally it takes 48h like you said.<br /><br />I might try and see if this runs on the foil. It smells quite sweet and sickly and almost like TCP.<br /><br />UPDATE: Tried running it on the foil, it melted kinda clearer than normal but quickly frazzled and didn&#039;t taste like no3 at all.<br /><br />Another update: Here&#039;s how it melted http://imgur.com/yEV4O8c

				I&#039;m sorry i misunderstood you. i thought you&#039;ve ordered wednesday and got it today, i reread and you&#039;re only waiting for it tomorrow.<br />I don&#039;t smoke either lol,- only IV, sublingual and parashuting, so can&#039;t give any advice how it runs etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard you can&#039;t smoke N4 as it&#039;s hydrochloride. But does it do it&#039;s job at all? How does it feel? Is it like H high or different? :)

				I&#039;ve only had 3 very small bumps so far, gradually increasing in size. I&#039;m being over-careful.<br /><br />All I&#039;ve got off it is a kind of body high, doesn&#039;t feel like H at all. I can feel it in my arms, I know that sounds weird but it&#039;s the only way I can describe it. It goes off quite quickly as well. The onset is about 1-2 mins after sniffing.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure when I hit an active dose I&#039;ll be able to explain the buzz better to you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve messaged supertrips saying that it isn&#039;t no4 and asking if he can tell me what it is as I don&#039;t want to OD.<br /><br />Do you think I should ask for a refund? He shouldn&#039;t be selling it as no4, it&#039;s very shady and downright dangerous. Do you think I should leave bad feedback? The problem is he doesn&#039;t have any active listing at the moment so I can&#039;t even read reviews. <br /><br />Would it be worth reporting it to the SR staff?<br /><br />Also I had to sign for it. Which I wasn&#039;t comfortable with.

I might leave the stuff out in the open at room temp and maybe this will help?!<br /><br />i also wanted to say that I dont think FM no4 is fent. I can compare this as today I also had a g of SunWu&#039;s synthetic heroin mix (Fentanyl and lactose) and although its been my first real &#039;knowing&#039; experience of fentanyl, they act quite differently. <br /><br />maybe FM new batch is the real deal. I&#039;m sure somewhere he wrote a report or copied n pasted a report that showed tests on his new no4 showing its purity and the fact it is actually heroin?<br /><br />&nbsp;:D

I&#039;d PM the vendor to start of,- like you did. I wouldn&#039;t report just yet, lets see what he says and offers to you. Have you FE?

				If it is fent - then it&#039;s short time action med 1-2 hours, but it can be benzos- then it can last for quite long. Don&#039;t panic, if nothing happen to you yet, then 100% you&#039;ll be alright. Try to sleep it off if you can.

				Sorry to hear about your experience.&nbsp; If you look in the main heroin thread UGS and ST were both selling this same stuff (bit late I know apologies!). Around 30 pages ago.&nbsp; ST was adamant it was #4 but refused to give a sample for a lab test.&nbsp; Some said the rush was intense but short acting.&nbsp; Although it wasn&#039;t H they liked it so hopefully don&#039;t do any more and you will be ok.<br /><br />Dr Holland and C63 are the #3 guys atm.&nbsp; With c63&#039;s stealth and efficiency and the fact it is free shipping, it really isn&#039;t that much more than the others and worth every penny.&nbsp; Remember to upload his pgp key as it changed a while back.&nbsp; I forgot and it delayed m order by a coupe days.&nbsp; :-[

				@shiftingsands Has your c63amg order arrived? Mine hasn&#039;t along with foreveryoungs (FY), I&#039;m getting a bit worried to say the least. Ordered from FY on Thursday and c63 on Wednesday.<br /><br />Only got enough gear from today and no bloody bitcoins. <br /><br />Also I gave that &quot;no4&quot; which is fent from supertrips another go yesterday. Really enjoying it. It&#039;s wonderful, you have a couple of bumps and within 30 seconds it&#039;s pure bliss. I think I hit a hotspot when I first did it as it was a pure white bit from a rock. I&#039;ve crushed it all up now and it&#039;s a consistent dose when I have a hit. I think I prefer it to smoking no3 to be honest.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to order some fent nasal spray from sunwu providing I haven&#039;t been caught. I hate this worried feeling when post doesn&#039;t arrive. Foreveryoung&#039;s stealth is not good at all which is my concern.

				Addaction takes a while. I&#039;m still with them, but when I first started it took a month to get to see their doctor and get a script. Things are different in all areas though. The GP gave me subbies on the day I saw him, but they were 0.1mg, I did the whole box on day one. I&#039;m on a Meth script at the mo, but I reduced to a low amount and I&#039;m suffering WD&#039;s now. Manageable but still not nice. I hope we get our gear tomorrow. I don&#039;t trust that dispater posted my order when he said he did. It was marked in transit 5 mins after my order. Good luck dabbs.

I know FM&#039;s domestic, but his gear was a little out of my price range, for the quantity, at the time. (although as soon as i have enough money im going to, and c63&#039;s because you&#039;re all raving about him)<br /><br />Start small, and grow DPR said in his &quot;few words&quot; and atm i cant afford to even entertain the risk with customs, because, being new to the road, and having a habit, bills, job, responsibilities, GIRLFRIENDgrr! etc its taking time to get my finances straight. Eventually i want to cut out seeing the twats who take my money irl, and just deal with the road, hopefully.<br /><br />My review might have seemed full-on, but i compared his with another vendors, which i had purchased at the same time, but received the next day, although the other was accepted and in transit within minutes, i also got a message to say its gone. the quality wasnt as good either, as well as the packaging. (a lot was stuck to the inside and in the seal of the baggy) <br />Looking back, it could also have been due to the euphoria of my first few successful orders on the road.<br /><br /><br /><br />**I&#039;ve been a slave to heroin for 10/11yrs, the street gear has changed a lot in that time, so i hope i know a little bit about heroin, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				There&#039;s no chance that the police are monitoring your mail and letting c63&#039;s order through to you. We&#039;re dealing with bull shit vendors and that&#039;s all. I wish I could order from my favourite c63, but I&#039;m skint until Saturday, so it would be a full week from now before I see anything. C63 is a proper vendor, I think some of these others are too small time to start up selling on here. Ideas above their station. Nothing wrong with starting small, but don&#039;t bite off more than you can chew and make promises that you can&#039;t keep. Fuck this. Fuck Joffrey, fuck the queen. (What a nerd I am)

				<br />I have done a fair few MST&#039;s back in the day.

				It does, you heard correct. I was clean was I was on the Suboxone, I have a Methadone script now, and I&#039;ve reduced a lot from what I was on. I&#039;ve only been using a few months. I moved to a new area and there seems to be literally no dealers in the gay old mining village where I live, I&#039;d have to scour Manchester or Liverpool, but then I found SR, so I&#039;m being bad again&nbsp; ;)<br />I have ordered from BO3 in the hope of something getting to me soon, as I&#039;m not too well. He&#039;s usually spot on for next day delivery, but by the times my coins were sorted I only managed to order at 16.30, so, let us pray to the Gear God someone mentioned earlier, not that it effects anyone else, but your positive vibes give me hope and strength!&nbsp; :D

				Haha I think I mentioned the gear god earlier ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m sure your order will arrive from bo3. I&#039;ve ordered from him at 6.30 and it&#039;s always turned up next day. I think he&#039;s the only vendor that&#039;s never let me down.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m high as a kite on c63&#039;s gear. It&#039;s not as strong or clean tasting as the last batch but still pisses all over the UK H. My partner literally can&#039;t smoke this batch, just the smell is making her vomit profusely. Poor lass. I&#039;ve been so kind as to let her have the last of the fent mix which by the way is wonderful and I&#039;ll be ordering some more asap. I love how every hit gives you a rush and redosing every hour or so suits me nicely. Sometimes I can&#039;t be monged all day.<br /><br />Take care !

				Sorry to hear that weeman, but when it arrives tomorrow it&#039;ll be a lovely treat, I think it&#039;s the best #3 on the road (I have yet to try #4). Also, c63&#039;s stealth is fucking awesome, I doubt it would get past a dogs nose but it&#039;d fool anyone else who didn&#039;t know the contents). <br />I received my BO3 order, nice gear, next day delivery, could do with being a bit cheaper, but I feel myself again, I had almost fucking detoxed myself!<br />Dispater&#039;s hasn&#039;t arrived still, fucking pleb, have you got yours Dabbs?

				I understand your right to be concerned but if you do your research you should be fine<br />this worked for me <br /><br />Here is the simplest CWE I can think of. It is easy and it takes less than 1 minute:<br /><br />All you need is: 2 glasses (or anything that can hold water); Tissue paper; Spoon (or your finger, anything to stir with); Water.<br /><br />STEP 1. Put pills in the first container. Pour enough COLD water to completely submerge pills (from the sink, no need to cool it in fridge). No need for excessive water. Stir untill all pills are completely dissolved.<br /><br />STEP 2. Take 2 pieces of tissue on top of each other, hold them on top of the second container like a filter; gently pour contents of container 1 through filter into container 2.<br />

				When did you order from Disaster, er, I mean Disappointment, I mean Dispater? I ordered Friday and still no show, but BO3&#039;s arrived today. Am I the only one who thought his name was Best On Three? And not Best One? Right when he arrived someone wrote in the comments that &quot;you really are the best on #3&quot;, so, there was at least one person like me! I&#039;ve only just clocked it now he writes &quot;best one&quot; in the listing!

				<br />Hi <br />My resend from Fy still has not shown up, gutted, he is not reading my messages now. Has anyone had anything from him lately??<br /><br />I have just placed an order with a new German vendor called junkiexxl, for a 0.25 sample of his No3, I had a bit of change in my account that I was eager to spend, but I was short of the postage. I have been messaging with him &amp; he said to select the domestic postage option. which was 0Btc.<br />So I&#039;m giving him a try. here is his page<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c8ae6bd409<br /><br />C

				Evening ladies and gents,<br /><br />Back after a week in the countryside, needed the break. Only though about gear once I was on my way home, it&#039;s SO fucking psychological the bastard stuff! Some days even looking at my car is a fucking trigger *head-desk*<br /><br />Anyway, bummed to see a few of you getting messed about by some UK vendors, either that or the postman is onto you and he&#039;s a junkie too. <br /><br />Japan - I&#039;m about to read your blackmail thread.<br /><br />To anyone asking the 100mg morphine tablets are pretty strong. I can usually smoke 0.5-1g of c63&#039;s stuff in one day as a comparison. I did 25ml methadone IV and one 100mg morphine tablet and was so shit faced I actually went to sleep. The morphine is very long acting, I was still really pinned and numb the next day and still feeling it a bit on day 3. I just crushed it between two teaspoons to break the slow release seal on the tablet and necked it with some water. Would love to have some more.<br /><br />Someone asked about Midnight Cowboy. Now this person gets great drugs, but intermittently and they have a habit themselves so don&#039;t be expecting 24 hour service. They will come through for you though, always keep you updated with good comms. They&#039;re away I believe until the end of this week. If you can spare the btc and have the time, well worth a look.<br /><br />Really want to order some more from c63 but I have so much shit to do these next few weeks.<br /><br /><br />Hope you&#039;re all well (not sick) and enjoying this great British summer.<br /><br /><br />

I&#039;m just scraping to get by also hence why I&#039;m quitting the gear for a while (one of the reasons anyway) or indefinitely but I don&#039;t want to think that way as I bloody love opiates. One last over the next week and the nasal spray will be the last of it.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up with regards to delivery time. I really hoped it would be here by the weekend as I&#039;m going to be left with a gap now and probably will have done WD&#039;s by the time it arrives!<br /><br />Found my usage rocketing recently, I&#039;m not longer a dabbler! C63&#039;s gram used to last me 5 days or so and now it&#039;s 2 days max. Also my partner is really wanting to stop using and I love her too much to carry on against her will. It makes her vomit non stop as well and I hate seeing her like that. I feel bad that I brought it into her life.<br /><br />Take care guy / girls.<br /><br />Dabs<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>can you post a link to c63 i cant seem to find him on search thanks

It&#039;s not as strong or clean tasting as the last batch but still pisses all over the UK H. My partner literally can&#039;t smoke this batch, just the smell is making her vomit profusely. Poor lass. I&#039;ve been so kind as to let her have the last of the fent mix which by the way is wonderful and I&#039;ll be ordering some more asap. I love how every hit gives you a rush and redosing every hour or so suits me nicely.

				Hey Japan, I ordered a 0.2 of BO3&#039;s best stuff because I needed 24 hour delivery. I&#039;ve been hanging out for days waiting for dispater&#039;s order which hasn&#039;t arrived and been sick as fuck. But today BO3&#039;s arrived. It&#039;s more than 0.2, you can see by eye. It&#039;s a lovely colour and cooks up really clean, smells great. I managed to get three medium strength hits from the little bag, it&#039;s too expensive, way more than c63&#039;s (!) but it arrives fast and is lovely. I saved the biggest hit for last and had it 2 hours ago. I was fully nodding for 30-45 mins and now I feel nice. Just a shame that I may have nothing tomorrow. His gear is nice though, best of the UK heroin that I have sampled. I wish I had more cash!<br />Oh, thought I&#039;d share with you that every time I say your name in my head I say it like they did in street fighter 2&nbsp; ;D ;)

His gear is nice though, best of the UK heroin that I have sampled. I wish I had more cash!<br />Oh, thought I&#039;d share with you that every time I say your name in my head I say it like they did in street fighter 2&nbsp; ;D ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Haha with the streetfighter 2!!<br /><br />Glad to know it&#039;s good gear - so expensive but like you I really need something for tomorrow. I&#039;m ok now, but I&#039;ll wake up rattling. Luckily my postie comes about 8:30am so I&#039;ll have to hope it arrives, it&#039;s in transit so I&#039;m sure it will...

				hello peeps, i have now tried all the uk vendors and without doubt the best value for money is dispater. Its better than some of the #3&#039;s sold for a lot more and for the money much better value than even jimmy boyle. I have been using for 30 + years now so I know what I&#039;m talking about. The package has always arrived promptly and with stealth. When I first started using SR I scoured the review threads looking for pointers so, having researched thoroughly I thought it only fair to share my findings. Peace and happiness to you all

That way you could almost guarantee them arriving at the same time. That would seem like a good plan unless of course happys coke is top stuff and c63&#039;s isn&#039;t.

This time I got Coke and washed it myself, the first pipe was soo strong I threw up!! not in a bad way, I almost like it!!<br />&nbsp;The gear is great about 20 lines and I&#039;m scratching my nose like crazy. <br />I think C63&#039;s Coke is really good the return from washing was great no need to whip it and a lovely yellowish rock that can not be much less in weight than what I started with.<br />I could waffle on and on, I think the afore mentioned Gear god is smiling today, and long may it continue.<br />Time for another pipe, I think. Have a nice afternoon everyone.<br />C <br />

Just try not to get Suboxone, try to get subutex or pure Bupe, as the suboxone have some thing like naltroxone in them to block any opiates, and make you rattle if you do take gear with them. Pure Bupe will not block the gear or make you sick if you do use.<br />I take subutex most days and gear will break through them no problem, if the gear is any good that is. That is why I like them. I was on a Methadone script for years and years, and could not get high off gear, I could feel it but not like I do now on the subbies.<br />Best of luck, the drug abuse centers seem to always make you wait, bloody stupid they want you to stop but won&#039;t help when you need them.<br />I hate being on a script it really ties you down, and you have to jump through all their hoops before they help.<br />Best of luck to you mate, &amp; plus 1 <br />C

				&nbsp;A Quick review of Seeds and Stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Quality Heroin - 1g (UK DOMESTIC) which is brown No.3:<br />Very quick delivery, I ordered on Sunday, it was in transit on Monday and delivered Tuesday! First Class Royal Mail used, so next day delivery (90% of the time.<br /><br />It was well packed, don,t want to say too much but was in heat sealed vac bag, if you had ordered something smelly it would not have been detected.<br />The stealth could be improved by using typed labels rather than hand written but I&nbsp; have spoken to vendor about this and they tell&nbsp; they like to vary their methods. (I still think typed is best IMO).<br /><br />The communication was truly excellent, this is an area where many vendors are a far too lax IMO. I know they are (well some are) very busy but customers do not like to be kept in the dark and having to wait 24 hour for a reply.These guys answer within a few hours (although whether they will be able to keep this up remains to be seen.<br /><br />Product weight was a tad over at 0.24g since the sample size was stated as being 0.2g (and yes my scales are accurate and regularly calibrated, complete with new batteries)<br /><br />Finally the product itself was good, and this gear was better IMO than nearly all the present UK vendors except TopNotch&#039;s Afghan Brown No.3, although he off the grid ATM. I would say that it was very similar in effect to theXchanges last batch of brown before he disappeared.<br />It does not dissolve completely in Vit C, leaving a small residue which can not be boiled up again like some brown&#039;s can to give a bit more. But the buzz is good and the legs are average and I was pleased with it.<br />For the price I think it is very good value for money, and I will use again.

				OK guys, so far I only count three of us, but that is far better than just one.<br />Anyone else not received from FOREVER young after it being marked in transit and 4 days elapsed? Please post here and let us know, we could go for a 100% refund if we can gather the evidence that FY has been selectively scamming.

Dont realy want to go about reporting people but i dont like my money sitting somewhere and i cant use it and a vendor that reads my messages and doesnt reply!! Also i have not finalized my order so should i get all my money back if this is sorted?? says i can cancel my order in 2days?&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Better not to report him unless we ALL report him together, otherwise it will be dealt by different Admin staff, and by the time they realize they have had multiple reports about the same person it may be to late.<br />Also reporting a vendor or even an item is for when they have broken the rules in a bad way, and this is not bad although it is to us. Trouble is, some of his orders are getting through so he has become a selective scammer or he has just plain forgotten, or and this is the most likely, one of his &quot;friends&quot; who does his letterbox run has ripped him off.<br />I urge you to join the thread that ukdabbler has started or post it below.

				Yes mate, if you don&#039;t mind. Would make it so much easier because I believe most people that are in this situation are newbies.<br />The only reason I discovered this site was because I did an H review for &quot;Seeds and Stuff&quot; and happened to notice it.<br />Up till&nbsp; then I had thought I was only one having trouble with FY. I am certain he never even posted them, probably got the people he asked to FE and the others mixed up. I know a bit about him as I was the very first to review his product when he joined SR!<br />Still, that is another story.<br />

				Sorry linas879cizauskas didn&#039;t see you there.<br /><br />It does seem though like you are clamoring for this hallowed free gram from dispater.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had no issues with the man, deliveries have varied from 1-3 days and quality has gone from decent to utter shite and back again.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like we&#039;re all ganging up on certain vendors, just that through the general experience of the people who post on this thread the most brings up certain trends. One trend is that dispater can be a bit touch and go at times.<br /><br />C&#039;est la vie. Don&#039;t get nasty about it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Where the fuck is Darktime? Hope the geezer is okay. Last I heard he had to get clean for a test... but that was 10 days ago.<br /><br />

I have read your posts back and your posts did seem to get lost in the spam, even thought they weren&#039;t. C&#039;est la vie. Welcome to thread (better late than never?)<br /><br />As far as c63 goes it normally arrives in 2-3 days after it has been posted. E.G. Order Monday - Posted Tuesday - Delivered Thursday/Friday.&nbsp; Really good service from the old Dutch/UK mail there.<br /><br />Jimmy Boyles stuff is ridiculously strong. I was staggering down the street like a drunk and I never get that shit faced, ever. I was gone. Really really good shit. The only problem is the price, cos I think you get better value from, say c63 as the gear is still strong but a lot cheaper. I&#039;ve had nothing but good stuff form Jimmy, I like him. And if I could afford his top level shit I would get it all the time. IT IS FUCKING STRONG, best gear ever.&nbsp; I smoke not IV btw.<br /><br />I really want to try his mid level stuff...but I have this fucking piss test coming up.....................<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hope that helped.

				Got some of uglydolls H through today - I must say for the price it is very good.<br /><br />It&#039;s soooo cheap compared to most EU dealers - 0.2 for ฿0.17 and 0.5 for ฿0.43 and grams at ฿0.82 with delivery only 0.01.<br /><br />Takes a little while to arrive, but I was pleasantly surprised about the quality - especially for the price.<br /><br />Good stealth also. I&#039;ll be a return customer for sure - but it&#039;s the type of order you wanna place when you have enough gear for about 5 days, as that&#039;s how long it took to arrive. So it&#039;s certainly not recommended for a quick fix.....I have some of Best3 better batch here and some of uglydolls, and there&#039;s not much in it quality wise to be honest - that&#039;s purely based on IV&#039;ing as I don&#039;t smoke.

For number 3 you&#039;re simply the cheapest vendor with decent gear. Better than all the UK stuff.<br /><br />I would be a 100% regular if the delivery speeds were quicker - but hey, I can&#039;t knock you for that as the quality price comparison is probably the best on SR.

				had a weird experience last night.&nbsp; in the morning some gear from dispater arrived, was rattling a bit and it sorted that - seemed all fine.&nbsp; after work had another hit - my tolerance aint that high - i only had about .25 all day but i was feeling better than i have for ages. i don&#039;t like nodding - prefer to be just this side of that - i was busying about the place doing this and that until about 2am - (had been awake since 4 am - not sleeping well lately).&nbsp; Can&#039;t explain why it felt so good.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using mostly local gear lately and it is crap tbh - just holds you and that&#039;s about it.&nbsp; gear didn&#039;t seem much different to the last bit i got online - didn&#039;t feel _that_ special when i banged it.&nbsp; damn i wish it felt that good all the time - would make all the other bullshit not matter a jot.

				Hello all!<br /><br />Dabbler - I have sent you a message on SR.<br /><br />Has anyone tried UkSupplier&#039;s &#039;Afghan Rock Heroin&#039;? I have had a punt on that today and will report back. Also after some of Beston3&#039;s more expensive tackle, as the 1/2 gram was not bery strong.

				Hello again all,<br /><br />&nbsp;I have just smoked my small bag of Ugly Doll&#039;s Brown, I have to say it is VERY good. The letter came in a few days, well packaged.<br />Best of all the Gear is very strong for the price. I am more stoned of 1, 0.2 bag than if I had smoked half a G of most of gear from non Dutch vendors.<br />It runs great on the jimmy and the effect is a lovely No3 high, itchy nose, very talkative, and a great sense of &#039;well being&#039;. It is the reason I love Smack<br />Thank you so much UD, I was not expecting any where near the quality you sent, it really is the best value for money I have had yet on SR, I mean a 10 bag and stoned just does not happen to me any more. <br />I hope to be able to use Ugly Doll&#039;s services often. Give them a try, my guess is that you will not be disappointed .<br />C <br /><br />

				Hi all,<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d check in and see how you&#039;re all doing. My time clean didn&#039;t last long, just placed an order with TN and Bo3. Who would you all say has the best value for money gear at the moment?<br /><br />I wish bo3 would list larger amounts as ordering 0.2 at a time fucking adds up. Dispater seems to be the best price but last time I had his gear a couple of weeks back it was shite.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;ve got an appointment with the doctor at addaction to get put on subbies at the end of the month and I&#039;m hoping that&#039;ll be it, me, done with this habit. The problem is, I really enjoy smoking H and if it wasn&#039;t for the money I&#039;d stay on it.<br /><br />Also thought I&#039;d let you all know, I&#039;ll be selling on SR in the next couple of months. I have a pretty decent grow on the go and of course will give you bunch a load of free samples when I start up. I don&#039;t smoke cannabis so no risk of me getting high on my own supply!<br /><br />/rant<br /><br />Take care guys

				Hi All,<br /><br />Seriously thinking about placing an order with a Dutch Vendor, Uglydoll. Unbelievable prices compared to the UK vendors. The only thing is i have no experience from ordering from her, assuming it&#039;s a her anyway. Her comms. r excellent, answered any questions i had about the product promptly.<br /><br />Lots of excellent Feedback on SR to, so all seems good. Would just like some confirmation from here if possible.<br /><br />Cheers guys.

				<br />&nbsp;Anyone else tries TopNotch&#039;s Gear lately?? I must say he has a great service, the gear is very strong, I just smoked a bag, 0.2. The taste is very funny though, kind of tastes like drinking chocolate smells, if you get me. I only smoke nower days so don&#039;t know how it goes in the &#039;works&#039;. The effect is good when smoked, it&#039;s just the taste to start is very strange. I seem to remember it long time back off the street. <br />I would be keen to know if anyone knows what the cut might be, &amp; is it possible it is drinking chocolate?? <br />I&#039;m not really moaning, just interested. Any way the gear is definitely well worth the dosh, even with a funny taste. It is probably the strongest from a UK vendor, other than JB&#039;s pure Afghan<br />C

				Hi<br />@gobstopper, not sure if its stronger than BO3, it is strong but has a funny taste when smoked that BO3 does not have.<br /><br />@jdddd C63&#039;s is stronger and a nicer smoke, but takes a few day&#039;s and you can&#039;t buy small bags. TopNotches arrives quick and it works very well even if it does taste a little chocolaty. I use c63 when I can plan ahead.When I just need a bag quick I would use TN then&nbsp; BO3. TN&#039;s is a lot cheaper than BO3 and for the price TN charges you can&#039;t go far wrong.<br /><br />Best of luck with whoever you choose.<br />C&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thanks man I almost exclusively order off c63 as I only smoke and in over a year he has never let me down but next day delivery is definitely tempting me so I might just put in my usual order with c63 then get a wee .2 of top notch so I can get a taste for it my self then next time I order il b in a better place to make up my mind. <br /><br />Just wondering has anyone used any of c63&#039;s gear in the last week or so just seen a few reviews complaining about quality and it doesnt seem like there is any consistent life for reviews on his own page in the forum? and to be honest I trust most of the reviews on here from the regulars more anyway

It withdraws other opiats from opiate receptors and settles itself on to them, if you&#039;re not withdrawing yet and take subs - what it&#039;ll do is it&#039;ll push all H out off of your receptors and it self will not be able to settle properly, causing you having the worst withdrawals ever!<br />&nbsp;Regarding buzz - all people say different things, I don&#039;t feel any high even if i IV 20-30 mg, subs have ceiling effect,- no matter how much you take you&#039;ll only get what you get. Some people say subs give them nice H-like buzz, i wouldn&#039;t count on that just in case not to be disapointed. It&#039;s good to keep physical withdrawals at the bay and that&#039;s it (for me)<br />Hope you&#039;ll be alright with tour subs, only take them when you feel really bad!!!<br />2 pakchoi23 - thanks mate for getting worried of me, hope you are alright :) I did have a hard week last week but i&#039;m fine now, have more LSD in transit. I&#039;ve got to stay clean now for my tests till 29 th, so i&#039;ll be enjoying lucy trips for a while :)<br />&nbsp;Hope you&#039;re all fine<br />I&#039;m with you!

				I had a batch from JunkieXXL. Not using H regularly, just for speed binges. But compared with c63 and FrankMatthews it was nearly equal, imo. <br />I smoked it. You can order small packs 0.25g, it&#039;s not expensive and shipping is as fast as it gets (domestic).<br />Speed is also very good quality. Not as cheap as used, but when it comes to speed i spend willingly more money for quality

				I will make a short review about my last gear which I got from some European vendors. It&#039;s about #3 which I smoked on foil. Place 1 was (in my opinion) the best, the last the worst. I bought from Frank Matthews, c63amg, uglydoll (NL), streetpharmacy, JunkieXXL (GER). I bought it in the last 1-2 months.<br /><br />1. c63amg - good quality stuff. I think he provides the best #3 from the European guys. Stealth is unbeatable.<br /><br />2. Frank Matthews - good stuff. Not as good as c63 but still okay for the price. But I don&#039;t like the taste from his brown stuff.<br /><br />3. streetpharmacy - stuff is okay. nothing unusual good or bad. Vendor from Germany, first choice for domestics.<br /><br />4. uglydoll - for the price it is very okay. I like that he (she?) sells small amounts, if you just want to have some nice hours an don&#039;t wanna spend so much money or wanna buy more (if you do this, you know you will smoke all of it&nbsp; ;)).<br /><br />5. JunkieXXL - it&#039;s really cheap, very fast shipping (from Germany), but in my opinion it was weaker than uglydolls stuff.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not 100% sure about the last 3, because before i tested them, i smoked c63 and FM&#039;s gear 1 / 2 weeks before. But it should fit.<br /><br /><br />Best regards

				Right boys and girls and men and women quick question here just wondering do any of you drink when u use? I only smoke usually H#3 normally off C63 the thing is I tend to enjoy a drink (probs more of a problem than my H use but im by no means an alco) but I know that using both is dangerous but recently ive found if I get in from a night a take a little toke float about the room for a while then ko. Was just wondering is there a certain limit that use would all say that you should in no circumstance use H after drinking and on the flip side of that whats safest amount to have drunk (other than none) when using ?<br /><br />Thansk for any help<br />take care, stay safe and avoid d Filth at all costs

I ordered on Friday night and it was in transit 15 minutes later, although I did not receive it until Monday, this was down to Royal Mail and not the vendor&#039;s fault. First Class Royal Mail used, so next day delivery should be normal.<br /><br />It was well packed, don&#039;t want to say too much but was in a heat sealed vac bag, if you had ordered something smelly it would not have been detected.<br /><br />The stealth was OK and it could be improved a tad by&nbsp; having a return address&nbsp; to blend it in with the regular business mail better, but this is a very minor thing.<br /><br />The communications were truly excellent, this is an area where many vendors could improve IMO. I know they are&nbsp; busy but customers do not like to be kept in the dark and having to wait 24 hours for a reply. These guys answer within a few hours (although whether they will be able to keep this up remains to be seen).<br /><br />The product itself looks like very light brown sugar, and dissolve easily in water at room temperature to give an almost colurless liquid. (I should point out that I have a&nbsp; tolerance to heroin although I do not have a habit) so I used 100mg in an IV injection.<br /><br />There was an immediate &quot;tingling/prickly&quot; sensation in my head that passed within a few seconds, and I have come across this before. Not much feeling of euphoria , but the buzz was good and the legs were average. I wish I could have done more.<br /><br />The product reminds me of the No.4 that Frank Matthews had about a 3 weeks ago. In particular,&nbsp; the &quot;tingling or pins and needles&quot; sensation which was identical only not as strong with this gear.<br /><br />The price seems good for UK, and I shall be ordering some soon to check it out properly and will update this thread to let people know.<br /><br />Looks like this good be a good vendor, No FE required, next day delivery, has PGP, so an &quot;A&quot; for starters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I don&#039;t want to sniff it and plugging it never works for me, so the only choice is to add something to make it smoke.<br /><br />Also if anyone is interested I got some crack from c63amg and it blew me away. some of the best crack I have smoked in a very long time.<br /><br />SS&nbsp; &nbsp;

				<br /><br />I too received my No3 from c63, the same as usual, bloody lovely No3. It runs great and taste lovely, but most of all it is very strong a few line and I have a proper buzz on, pinned to fuck.<br />I ordered half of his free base too &amp; it is a lot nicer than the last time I had any from him. Thanks to shifting sands I think, he recommended it.<br />I ordered it all Monday night and it arrived today, quicker than some domestic orders I have made.<br />C63amg really is a great seller, his communication is great, even if some is automated responses, you always know whats going on &amp; for me that is very important. I hope he carries on for a long long time. If you read this C63 thank you very much.<br />C

				Hi, didn&#039;t know this thread was here.....been reading the thread in rumour mill thinking &quot;why no&nbsp; UK reviews?&#039;!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m after ordering a gram of brown off a UK vendor this week, or maybe .5 of Jimmy Boyles mid range if that&#039;s better value. Just wanted to know what everyone thinks of the UK vendors at moment. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ordered of Dispater and beston3 before, both sent me half decent gear that seemed&nbsp; about the same as I&#039;d get round here. Bit dear but not scored on street round here for years anyway. Been wearing subutex handcuffs! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I first found SR last year I was on 8mg subs. I tried getting some gear few times, first .2 then .5 then a g. I must have a slow metabolism because even 3 days after stopping the subs couldn&#039;t really feel it. It was fucking frustrating. The worst thing was, as soon as you start to be able to feel it a bit, its like the reflex kicks in and you cane it round and round the foil thinking &quot;just a bit more and I&#039;ll be there.....just a bit more&quot; till its all gone.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ended up hitting the last of it up but still didn&#039;t feel it right. So I realised there was no point in trying until I reduced my sub dose<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had an IV habit since late 90s, but in recenter years stuck to smoking and found (with a bit of black market meth and benzos) it was much easier to control. Then a few years ago my younger brother died (of alcohol overdose! Choked in his sleep)and I had my children and been on subs ever since. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, this year decided to reduce the subs. Partly because of unwanted side effects....partly because at the back of my mind I want to get high. Had a few brnzos but there just not the same....nice at first but stop working after a couple of days.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Couple of months ago was down to 4.8 mg.....tried with Dispaters and Beston3s gear....better this time, could feel it a bit after maybe 36 hours, but still ending up caning it too fast before could proper feel it. Ending up hitting it again and got a bit scared how quickly you get obsessed with the needle. I have to hit in my legs as I can&#039;t have marks on my arms, and the veins aren&#039;t great there... Or im not as practised at hitting them!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I&#039;m down to 3mg and I&#039;m thinking of scoring another g....don&#039;t really want to hit it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dispater would prob be my first choice, but seems to have been swamped recently. Also he has a big stack of identical feedback for 0.5 listing....seems strange why someone would order 5 lots of .5 as its more dear? Maybe a bug in the feedback.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Top notch? Don&#039;t really want cocoa in my gear! I know whatever I get its likely cut, but,....drinking chocolate?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the sound of Jimmy Boyles mid range, but its nearly twice the price, is it twice as strong?&nbsp; In a way, because of the sub blocking problem, I might prefer quantity over quality...so I&#039;ve got something to smoke while I&#039;m waiting for subs to wear off.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wait rose sounds interesting because never had no. 4 but I don&#039;t really want to start hitting again. Its been so hot recently i need to wear shorts! Also, I like running it on foil, its a pleasant ritual.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any thoughts?<br /><br />(Please no advice that I should leave gear alone. I know I should but I know I&#039;m not going to....you know how it is!)

				Hey Hungry Ghost, My advice is to not do it in the first place, you would be better off learning a trade and bla bla bla.&nbsp; only joking. Topnotch was nice today, no coca taste and very strong. Can&#039;t say anything about any other vendor as TN is my vendor of choice right now and as I said the coca taste had gone today. Hope that helps.

				<br />&nbsp;@Hungry ghost, I&#039;m on a subutex script too &amp; your drug history is similar to mine, I&#039;m now on 4 mg and smoke gear about 2 days a week, some times a bit more...&nbsp; I use subbies early in the morning and when I get home from work to a delivery I can usually get stoned, it takes a bit more than if you can wait til the next morning.&nbsp; Some times if the Gear is not the best 0.5g don&#039;t really get me high. Recently I have had C63&#039;s and that will definitely get me stoned it is very strong and only ten lines &amp; I am stoned.&nbsp; JB&#039;s&nbsp; is good too very dear but very good.&nbsp; Topnotch&#039;s is very strong for UK gear.

				Good Evening,<br /><br /><br />We have some new listings up from a new product.

				Can&#039;t help much with international orders I&#039;m afraid. Best you can do is scan through the last few pages and pick up the names of decent vendors, then check their pages to see if they ship to USA. I can tell you now jimmy boyle won&#039;t ship international.<br /><br />As for triggers.... fucking everything is a trigger on a bad day. Phones, money, smells, a certain piece of clothing, a certain colour clipper. Worse thing is when you&#039;ve been clean a while and think you have all triggers under control when a new one pops up out the blue...especially now I use Silk Road. Extra triggers everywhere.<br /><br />First 10 times I used the road I thought I was going to have a heart attack right from ordering the btc to the gear coming thro the door. SO much fucking adrenalin and anxiety/anticipation/excitement/fear.<br /><br />It&#039;s an arse how psychological WDs can hit you as well...&nbsp; but this is all stuff for a different thread.<br /><br />I have my g of jimmy boyles medium through the post today so I am a happy bunny. Still strong as fook. Took 21 hours from me clicking buy to it being in my hands. Fandabbydozee.<br />

I hope no one is missing an order because he sent me 2. The gear is very strong, it still has a faint chocolaty smell but the taste is not as chocky as it was. It smell like mini eggs, my mrs said much better than the usual fishy smell. <br /><br />Not tried uk777&#039;s yet but I will let you know how it is.<br />C&nbsp;

				That&#039;s good to hear, I&#039;ve got a .2 of Top Notchs coming this morning (I hope, marked in transit yesterday so should be) Finished the last of JBs gear last night, luckily I realised it wasn&#039;t going to last and bought some more codiene for this morning. With the long half life of the subs, I tend to forget I&#039;ve still got a habit, but woke up feeling rough this morning.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, someone posted a cold water extraction a few pages back, but I thought I&#039;d post my version that I use. I wish I&#039;d known how to do this back in the day as it would have saved my arse a few times.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You need coffee filter papers. Not many places sell them these days but its worth looking around as 1 packet will last you. I use two tucked inside one another with the seams at opposite sides.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make a makeshift funnel by cutting the top off a lemonade bottle, or use a real funnel. Line it with the coffee filters, might need tp fold them slightly. Soak them down with cold water so they don&#039;t absorb as much codiene water.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, ddissolve the tablets. You can do two packets cocodamol (about 500mg codiene) in one go, but any more and it just clogs the filters. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you aren&#039;t in a hurry, just pour on warm/hot water, (not too hot, you should be able to put fingers in it) and the tablets will dissolve (use about 300ml water). Then put in freezer until ice starts to form<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are in a hurry, crush the tablets to powder with a pestle and mortar (or bottom of a glass medicine bottle and a bowl) and dissolve in cold water.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then stick the filter funnel on a glass and pour in mixture. The codiene water should drip through and be more or less clear. About half will come through pretty quick, the rest in an hour or so. Put it in fridge to finish off as the colder it is the less paracetemol will be in it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then just drink the water. You won&#039;t get high off it if you have any kind of habit, but it will hold you while your waiting for the postman!

				Hi people,<br /><br />I hope your all well, &amp; having a good evening.<br /><br />I have started the bag from UK777, &amp; I have to say it is very good gear, tastes really nice. &amp; even though I&#039;m stoned off TN&#039;s gear and&nbsp; I have smoked half a G of shines69&#039;s Coke that I had washed., I can still feel UK777&#039;s gear through it. It runs OK on the foil, it does not have a &#039;Red&#039; tinge to the beetle, the size of the bags are bang on.<br />He ships very quickly, my order came in well under 24hrs, I ordered at about 4 or 5 pm at it arrived early the next morning, it couldn&#039;t be better than that. His packaging is very good too, very like another popular vendor. It is over and above what is needed for a domestic shipment, but I guess &#039;Belt &amp; Braces&#039; is the idea, after all , you can not be too safe.<br />I hope UK777 stays around for a long time and if he does he will soon be in the top % of vendors.<br />If you read this UK777, thanks and I will be back soon.<br /><br />C

				Aah bollocks let down by the royal mail yesterday. Went round to check my drop at lunchtime, know the postman always comes before then. Nothing. You know how that feels...sweating....checking the junk mail frantically &#039;it must be here somewhere!&#039; Ordered off TN early thursday and marked in transit as usual about 5:30....stuff usually comes next day but sometimes not. I wish we had teleporters too...have to work through Tor though!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had to go away four the day so said fuck it and went back on my subs. Dissapointing because had house to myself last night and after 3 days off the subs was planning to have a nice old toot in front of telly with feet up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not doing the &#039;please Mr postman&#039; bit this morning, had my subs as usual. Mrs is about all day and we are meant to be going out tonight so if it does come ill just save it for tomorrow morning.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve done two &#039;long mornings&#039; this week already, where you miss your subs and wait for postman.....I know you&#039;re not meant to start WDs off subs for 36 hrs but I find I feel pretty on edge if I miss a morning and it just seems forever until 12. Not doing it again&nbsp; this morning, I never really believe stuff will come on a Saturday anyway.

				Tell you what tho there seems to be some nice UK gear on SR at moment. When I started there was one UK vendor called AfghanApothecary, and it was take it or leave it....His gear was variable, had some decent stuff off him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That stuff off JB was fuckin quality though. And it sounds like there&#039;s a few others.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve not bought gear locally for years....it was still 10bags last time, don&#039;t know if it still is, they were&nbsp; getting pretty small. One of my closest friends is still into the gear so I could go to him but I don&#039;t really want to have it just a phone call away.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway the other night i saw this guy and he had some gear&nbsp; he&#039;d got locally and he said &#039;its pretty strong&#039; he pulled out the foil and it was a tiny blob of red orange gear. You know when it leaves orange trails. I pulled out mine, it was half of the .5 I got off JB.&nbsp; he&#039;d paid £20 for his, I&#039;d paid about £30, but the beetle on mine was huge in comparison, and I&#039;d been through two foils already! Mine was dark and shiny and didn&#039;t leave any trail at first, then started to leave a dark trail later on.It was basically like the gear I used to get when I started in the early 90s.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve been thinking the gear on SR was expensive but if the local gear is like that its not too bad. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still in my head I think of gear as being £50 a gram and &lt;£150 an eighth but that was over ten years ago.....drug prices are resistant to inflation, it was bad enough when phone boxes went up to 20p! When I last bought on street it was still ten bags. They started as being .2 but had been getting smaller and smaller over time. I don&#039;t know if the market has made the jump to a £20 bag standard yet?

				Well top notches gear arrived this morning, making me wish I&#039;d held out and not took me subs. Put it on the foil anyway and it seems like good stuff. Definitely comparable to JBs mid range stuff, they are similar in price too. Can&#039;t taste chocolate although it does have a slight sickly sweet taste. Harsh on the throat but I like that, it makes you feel like you are getting something. Had a few lines and I can feel it, now I&#039;ve just got to resist the urge to boot it all today and save it for tomorrow! Good times for UK smack on the road!

				Hi guys, SP<br /><br />SP have you used a uk vendor recently. I want to order today but not sure who to go to.&nbsp; TN is offering 1/3rd off his .2 but that&#039;s a very small amount to purchase. I could buy 5 of them. Do you think Japan has changed his name maybe. I personally think that that should be done every so often. I think its good to have two or three forum names and two or three sr names in case you need to lose one or two. Some people might not want hero member status or sr accounts with lots of big transactions. Just a thought.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				2 SS - ohh.. right... i didn&#039;t think about it... i myself have another account on SR with only 3 transactions in it... i might start using it one day&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Regarding UK H vendors - i&nbsp; stopped ordering from UK after TN gone and even after he is back i still stick to Dutch vendors - c63 and FM are the only ones I buy H from,- c63 is good for his N3 and FM for his N4. After i tried them i don&#039;t want UK quality any more - really big difference! TN quality was always good but it had black tar junk floating in the solution after H being cocked. One thing isn&#039;t nice though is you have to wait 2-3 days for your package with c63 and sometimes longer with FM cuz not always he dispatches next day. From my previous post you can see that my last order is processing for 4 days now. So can&#039;t give you any advice on UK vendors really, sorry. UK vendors H (excluding TN) is way too weak and expensive, IMHO<br />Regards

				my ting from junkiexxl came thru today, which is pretty quick as he only sent it saturday, today is tuesday and to the uk as well. the gear is average grade but for £13 for a 1/4 gram i wouldn&#039;t complain. it does have a bit of a sugar cut which is noticeable by the sticky beetle and the dark dots left on the foil residue. but i did have a nice buzz from just smoking 1/3 of the bag, and it runs perfectly fine as well. its as good as most of what you buy on the streets and about street prices as well. so yeah it was alright, i&#039;d definitely buy again at that price and speed of delivery.

				Hi again,<br /><br />I have just smoked a bag off seeds &amp; stuff, their gear is really quite strong, half the bag &amp; I&#039;m quite stoned. The only thing I could&nbsp; say is that it runs dirty on the foil, not that it really matters, as long as it gets me stoned, I&#039;m not to worried, so long as its not cut with summat nasty like Roselin, &amp; my guess would be that this gear is cut with some sort of sugar. <br /><br />I ordered from TN at the same time, &amp;&nbsp; I hope that one turns up tomorrow <br /><br />@xiferz, has disp&#039;s gear improved then? I have not used his for a while as the last half a G I had off him did not touch me at all. I was a regular buyer from him, but since his 24hr service became iffy and the gear very variable or weak I have not been so regular, I simply can not afford to buy weak gear and as he does not sell the 0.3g bags anymore&nbsp; I can&#039;t but a little bit to try before ordering anything more .<br /><br />C<br /><br />

				what is the problem with that dispator ? i put an order in on monday and today it is still in processing , he was on today and put on his page most of the orders before 14/08 have been sent MOST ??? does he sell stuff or not what is that all about most, why not all have been sent so now i need to wait till he comes back on in a couple of days thats not right at all . if i had ordered from a holland vendor i would be getting it tomorrow and the quality would be a lot better . im sick of vendors like this

				Got my first package yesterday!I am posting today cause I ve been chasing the dragon...<br />Frank Matthews was the vendor...The package shipped Monday at 1:37pm UTC. I finalized later at 6:30pm UTC.Either Frank made the shipment before my FE although it was my first order with him(my first SR order) or he is shiping till early evening.Whatever the case respect!<br />Packaging was excellent-only prblm was that he didnt give a false shipping address on the envelope(that may raise a flag since its from holland) but other than that everything was perfect.The weight was spot on and the quality is amazing.<br />Frank gives real value to the costumer.I ll through lots of business his way.<br />

				<br /><br />Afternoon UK people<br /><br />&nbsp;My order from TN turned up this morning, I had 2x0.2g bags with a third off the price, so 0.4 for about £30. <br />&nbsp;I think the gear is stronger than last week it looks a little lighter to me too. It still had a very faint Nesquick, chocolatey smell but<br />&nbsp;I am growing to like the taste &amp; smell, it runs nicely on the foil. Half a bag &amp; I&#039;m quite stoned already.&nbsp; &nbsp;All in all for the price I know you will not get better from a UK seller, his speed of delivery is good as is his stealth, which to me adds up to the best choice for Brown from a UK seller.<br />I&#039;m so glad he came back and I hope he&#039;s around for a long time.<br /><br />I hope your all well &amp; have plenty to keep you well,.<br /><br />C&nbsp; 8)

				i ordered a bag off uk777 yesterday at around 2.30. he messaged me at 5 to say it would be going in the post any moment and would be there for the last pick up at 6. it arrived here at 11.30 this morning so was as quick as you could possibly get. the gear is strong, has me buzzed up nicely right now. altho it does have a dark residue(not frazzle tho) on the foil and doesn&#039;t run forever it has a lovely strong taste that i haven&#039;t tasted in gear for prolly a good 10 years now. its just its 27 quid for a .2. i could get .6 on the street for that much, not as strong but i guess the amount would prolly make up for that. if ukk777 did maybe a .3 for that price i would prolly buy off him a lot more often, but i&#039;ll defo buy off him again when i&#039;m more flush.

				Got my H sample pack this morning but pretty sure I&#039;ve been sent the #2 sample(again) as it was weak.<br />I have contacted c63amg to clarify that what he sent me was a mistake and am waiting on a reply.Will update when I have spoken to him.<br /><br />Hope everyones safe and practicing good injecting techniques if thats your ROA.<br /><br />NEVER SHARE!!!<br /><br />All paraphernalia is free from your local needle exchange.If you live in the sticks then make sure you stock up well when you do head to town or you can even buy what you need from SR (although its expensive considering its free) Also I used to know a Tesco that used to sell 10x 1ml works for £1 but I&#039;m not sure if they still do.Some exchanges or chemists will even send you some in the post though there maybe a small charge for this service.<br />What I&#039;m getting at is there is NO excuse for sharing needles!!Dont be a smelly,skinny,scumbag, disease ridden,infected junkie.....Be a responsible heroin addict/user.Take your used pins back to the exchange.How would you like to sit down on the grass in your local park only to be stabbed in the arse with a dis-guarded works??

				i am still waiting for the sample that should not be the B grade (even though readung through the posts i am not that hopeful that it won&#039;t be) anyway can anyone that had the B grade give a description of the gear (color, texture, smell, taste) so that i can tell which one i will receive??

				i did receive the sample from c63 but since in my country we don&#039;t have any good H at all (well not never but it&#039;s really rare to get anything that is not almost entirely cut) i can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s the #3 or the B grade...it was a pretty big sample it looked more like .25 i shot it all and i had a good rush and it lasted for a while...keep in mind that i am on methadone treatment so i feel very much less than anyone who isn&#039;t...

				The reason the c63 samples may be taking a bit of time is because it says that he only processes 10 a day.&nbsp; Perhaps they were more popular than he aniticipated with the chippers.&nbsp; Could be also that he has placed less priority on them.&nbsp; I am a little worried as I have made an order with c63 so hope I get the good stuff.&nbsp; I notice the last batch I got was slightly darker brown than I am used to and didnt seem quite as strong altho still top gear.<br /><br />I also had an order with Topnotch.&nbsp; The gear is strong, domestic and quick.&nbsp; There was a small problem with me encrypting my address and I missed the cut off for that day.&nbsp; TN very generously topped up my order even though it was not his fault. kudos.&nbsp; The hot chocolate is a lot more subtle now as well.&nbsp; Hoep he keeps this consitency and sticks around.&nbsp; He is a staple diet for a UK h lover.<br /><br />Also remember it is bank holiday monday coming up so orders only start on tuesday if you need to ration any gear&nbsp; ;)

				my internet got cut off friday night so i not been able to post. but the order c63 marked in transit on wednesday last week arrived on saturday morning, i got 1G of his A grade brown and half G of his crack. and fuck me if that crack wasn&#039;t the best bit of rock i had in years. blows anything currently on the street in the UK to pieces. it had that lovely proper crack taste like you used to get in the early/mid 90s, so i knew as i let that smoke out it was gonna hit hard, and it fucking did alright. <br /><br />as for the A grade brown he sent me, it was .3 over and way better than the B grade tester he sent me last week. i fucking impressed.<br /><br />to the guy who wants to know how to tell the difference between his A and B grade stuff. his B grade stuff has a sugar cut and his A grade doesn&#039;t. to test this just let the beetle settle and cool down. then with the foil on a flat surface like a table, dab the beetle with your finger tip. gear with a sugar cut will stick to your finger, if there is no sugar cut then it will not stick. his A grade stuff had a very very slight stick that just fell back onto the table before you could lift your finger a few inches. his B grade stuff is quite sticky tho. you can literally hold your finger there with the beetle stuck to it for ages. <br /><br />when you melt sugar it turns to caramel which is sticky, there&#039;s no way to disguise that fact when its cut into gear, your beetle will be sticky. the more sugar the more stickier.

				i actually went down the shop and came back to find the btc price had risen slightly and i had enough to order. so i didn&#039;t get it in till late at 4.30 but by 5.00 i had a message from him and he told me it had gone in the mail already. i checked my orders and it was marked in transit too. he also told me in a message that it is c63s A grade gear so i&#039;m looking forward to it. i told him if it went good i would give him a nice review. if i get it tomorrow and it is c63s A grade then i&#039;ll do him an awesome review. i&#039;m really hoping it does coz i think we could really do with a good UK seller with good gear atm.

I would guess that they will become a top vendor very quickly if they can keep to C63&#039;s quality, I&#039;m quite excited now, I will be well chuffed if it is the C mans brown. Thanks for letting us know isallmememe, I agree with you, the more UK seller there are the better for us buyers.<br />C

				I believe you can smoke crack off foil but you are better making a pipe. A lot ofppeople use an asthma inhaler with foil bowl, or waterless bong made out ofa small plastic bottle and a biro tube. Make sure its airtight and flick a nice fat ciggy ash on the bowl. Then place rock on top of ash. The ash is to support the crack as it liquefys.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Goddamn it I want a pipe now. Never really been a big crack head but it is kind of moreish. I cant imagine using crack without some brown to finish off.

Its more of a creeper. If you&#039;ve never had a pipe before, maybe you&#039;d get a nice feeling from smoking it on foil, but once you&#039;ve piped crack, you&#039;ll never go back. i use a coke bottle, filled 3/4 with water and a biro with foil cap+ash. chewing gum is a good sealant for round the biro&nbsp; (the water is purely for having less air in the bottle, to make the smoke more condensed)<br />Man i want a pipe now too! lol<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait for the postie now its confirmed as c63&#039;s good stuff w/no cut. And agree, if he can get his next day delivery down, he&#039;ll be a busy man!<br /><br />Regards<br />Linas

				for the ultimate crack pipe, get a hack saw and cut a clipper lighter in half. with the lower half of the lighter drill a hole around halfway, cut a biro tube in half and stick it in the hole with blue tac to seal. then foil up the top with a lastic band and put your holes in. bit of ash and you&#039;re good. there is hardly any air in the pipe to start with so you are literally getting pure smoke. hits you like a fucking steam train, its the best pipe i ever had and is also nice and discreet and easy to hide etc. plus you get just as much back when you wash it out with acetone.

				i was so impressed with All Drugs UK that i said i would do a review for him, so here it is. i got to admit when i first considered ordering from him there were a couple of things that made me a little nervous. the fact that there were no feedbacks for that particular product in his listing said to me that he hadn&#039;t sold any yet. i wondered if that might be coz he hadn&#039;t got stocked yet or maybe other buyers knew something i didn&#039;t, but then i saw his stats were pretty good, so i figured i&#039;d probably give him a try tho. the other thing was that i noticed he charges £2 for postage which is way more than sending a letter weighing a little more than .2 of a gram first class UK to UK would be. this made me wonder if he was being a bit dodgy and trying to sucker people into thinking his gear was cheaper than it looked. anyway i gave him the benefit of the doubt, so here goes...<br /><br />communication 5/5 - i initially messaged him around 12/1pm yesterday, while i was waiting for my btc to clear in my sr account, inquiring about why the product had no feedback and if he definitely had it in stock. he hadn&#039;t answered by 4.30 when i was wanting to order for the 5pm cut off, so as to catch the post for that day. so i took a chance and ordered it anyway. he actually answered me about 10 minutes later saying that he had only started selling the product on saturday and as of yet the few orders he had already, had not finalized yet. this was the point when he told me that the gear he had was in fact c63&#039;s A grade gear. i messaged back straight away asking if i had caught the order in time for that days post and he replied at about 5.30 to tell me it had in fact just been posted and i noticed it was then marked in transit. i&#039;ve messaged him numerous times and had 5 replies answering just about everything i inquired about, which is a lot more than you would get from most vendors. so top marks for comms.<br /><br />stealth/packaging - 4/5 this is the only thing i can fault him on as the item was not vac packed. it was domestic tho so the risk was minimal, but i did message him to say he really does need to look at vacuuming asap. <br /><br />shipping 5/5 -as i said i ordered at 4.30pm yesterday and it landed here at 11.30 this morning, so for speed i am actually very very impressed. i really didn&#039;t expect the royal mail to move it that fast but they did. so absolutely maximum points on speed.<br /><br />product 6/5 - i actually had c63&#039;s A grade on saturday and this was exactly the same. there is no sugar cut like c63&#039;s B grade gear has, the beetle is not at all sticky when it goes hard. this gear is a really nice smoke, leaves a nice residue that&#039;s not too dark or not too clear, which is perfect. if you think of the best gear you&#039;ve ever bought on the street, and this is easily on a par with that. it is quite rare to get gear of this quality on the street these days, so probably worth the slightly extra price. also i weighed the gear, it came separated in two .1 wraps which both weighed in at .11, so was slightly over weight too.<br /><br />so yeah All Drugs Uk gets top marks from me. from my experience of dealing with him he has certainly well deserved this good review. i know a few people have posted here saying they had a little trouble waiting, but that certainly isn&#039;t the experience i had. as long as he keeps up a service like this i will probably use him all the time. he is a little more expensive than c63, but for the next day delivery i think its probably worth the extra bit of coin.<br /><br />i also messaged him this morning suggesting that he would do well if he started selling c63s crack as well. he messaged me back prettty soon after telling me that he has that planned at some point. i also suggested that a .2 of each heroin/crack combo could be a popular listing and he told me that he knows that both white and brown go well together, so hopefully we will see that listed soon too.<br /><br />in fact post a reply ITT if you think a .2 heroin/crack combo would be something you would order. hopefully we can get it listed soon.<br /><br />

				Hi All<br /><br />all drugs UK, I got my sample too, I could not say if its C63&#039;s as my last off him was a couple of weeks back now, I can say its nice strong gear and with the TN listings down I will be getting some more ASAP.<br /><br />I buy&nbsp; a lot of Coke on the road and wash it up myself. I have tried lots of the crack sold on SR &amp; it does not come close to the crack I wash mysel.<br />I had some from C63 a few weeks ago now, &amp; it was strong, but no numbing and it tasted weird. Normally I can sleep after a session, as long as I have Brown, I could not sleep on that even when I&#039;d smoked a ton of gear, very speedy.<br />C

				Ah great that&#039;s reassuring that someone is in same boat. (SR and forums are fucking laggy recentlyl . it takes multiple tries to connect)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I too have been tempted to order some opium just to see what its like.Still, I imagine it would be just like weaker heroin, and I&#039;d end up wishing I&#039;d just got good ol&#039; skag. I have had morphine tablets in past and while they were very pleasant they weren&#039;t as potent as I&#039;d hoped.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The same goes for all these oxy and hydro dugs from US. When I first found SR I thought &#039;nows my chance to try all these exotic&nbsp; opiates.&#039; But then I saw the prices!&nbsp; Like £80 for a single pill. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re very nice and that but you could get a gram of smack for that. Are they really that nice? Or is it just people want to avoid the stigma associated with heroin ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still when I am feeling flush I might fancy a little blob of opium.

				yeah i can imagine it being a bit unnerving having to pick it up like that. but you do still legally have plausible deniability. you don&#039;t stand more susceptible legally in court because you signed for a package or even went to pick one up from the post office. its totally reasonable to accept that somebody would sign for a package that was sent to them even tho they had no prior knowledge that a sign for parcel was sent to them. just about anybody would. try asking a postman if they&#039;ve ever had somebody refuse to sign for and accept a letter and i bet they probably haven&#039;t or it would have only happened once or twice.

				damn life sux.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been trying to post an order all day, had to wait for coins - had to go out before they arrived when i got home transferred them to SR but since then not been able to get a page served - times out everytime.&nbsp; not going to get a delivery tomorrow now.&nbsp; that means scraping cash to buy some locally which will be crap.&nbsp; there&#039;s no point to this message now - just need to vent my frustration.<br /><br />Was going to ask about UK suppliers and their delivery/despatch times - are they usually quick to send? doesn&#039;t matter so much now - can&#039;t get sent before monday...

				yes the weekends can be a bitch when it comes to sr huh?<br /><br />i can say that my order from all drugs uk did come in less than 24 hours when i ordered from him last week. but then i did notice that he doesn&#039;t really live that far from me, so that might be why. some others have waited 2 days for his goods. he does also offer a sign for post but it a bit pricey at £4, but should be next day i would have thought.

				received today .5 of #3, amazing stuff. The package arrived on monday which is amazingly fast to EU not domestic since i ordered on thursday, but &quot;thanks&quot; to my post man i got it only today. I absolutely fuckin&#039; hate this guy, it seems that he can not read my name on the door bell or the mailbox that is written in capital letters. C63 is amazing on the other hand. Even if he asked me to FE cause i have less than 10 trans, i did it really with no problem because i was sure it will be sent. I was getting a little ansy after a week but when i saw that it arrived Monday i was so pissed...long story short C63 is the MAN for H users in the EU for #3 i wish he had also some killer #4 for us..oh well i am out...

				Been ordering off all drugs as he seems to have some cracking brown, uncut from Europe. Best stuff I have had of SR, proper gouching tackle. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However he has been marking things in transit in an unorthodox manner which is confusing. Normally a vendor marks in transit late afternoon and this means it was posted that day and (RM doing their stuff) can be expected tomorrow.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first order I made was a Monday morning, well before cut off of 2 pm. It didn&#039;t mark in transit till early hours (3am -5am Tue) leaving me confused as whether it was sent it not. It didn&#039;t turn up until wed, presumably having being sent Tue. No problem, just confusing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next order I made late on this Monday night to catch the Tue delivery. Sureenough it was marked in transit early hours Tue, and landed Wednesday. I felt I had spotted a pattern!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So last night (about 2am) I made another order, hoping it would be marked in transit early this morning and arrive Fri. However it has processed all day, and marked in transit about 8pm tonight, leaving me confused whether it was sent today or will be sent tomorrow. He has also updated his page to say that processing may take 2 days due to Tor problems.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I don&#039;t know whether to miss my subs tomorrow and check drop, or wait till Saturday.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its a minor gripe really, maybe he likes to change up transit times to throw off LE. I&#039;m just used to a late afternoon &#039;in transit&#039; meaning it will come tomorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also he has stopped doing his .2 bags it seems. At just over £20 these were fucking top value for such good gear. You can buy two 0.1 samples but that&#039;s closer to £30 and not such a bargain. I don&#039;t often have £50-£60 to throw on gear, but £20 odd is always double. Bring back .2 bags All Drugs! Make an old junky very happy!

The blockade occurs at &gt;2mg. So if you are taking 12 mg a day after 36 hrs you have 6 left in you, after 72 hours (3 days) you have 3mg left and are still blocked.&nbsp; It is made worse however if you have been taking 12 mg every 24 hrs for a while. After 24 hrs say you have 8mg left in blood, you take next 12=20. After 24 hrs you have maybe 12 left, +12=24. After 24 hrs you have maybe 16 left+12=28. After 24 hrs maybe 20+12=32........so your blood level levels off at TWICE or so the dose you are actually taking. Thus the time for blood levels to drop are even longer.<br /><br />TL;DR: you ain&#039;t getting high any time soon my friend. Listen to the voice of bitter experience. This is why buprenorphine is so effective in weaning junkys off heroin. If you want to use you need to get down to 2-3 mg

				Aah fent might be different.&nbsp; I only ever tried with H. I&#039;m not sure where fent fits in the old &#039;affinity to opiate receptors&#039; hierarchy. You might get a short acting high. Maybe fent has a higher affinity than bupe. You can hope anyway! Good luck.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally your best bet is to taper down to 4mg. It isn&#039;t hard at all to taper, just do a mg a week. Don&#039;t tell the prescribing drug agency (those fuckers haven&#039;t a clue anyway) and you&#039;ll have a nice stash of subs build up as well.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always found it fairly easy to taper off meth or subs, its just that last bit that&#039;s the killer. When your body starts to realise no more opiates are coming.......

Best stuff I have had of SR, proper gouching tackle. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However he has been marking things in transit in an unorthodox manner which is confusing. Normally a vendor marks in transit late afternoon and this means it was posted that day and (RM doing their stuff) can be expected tomorrow.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first order I made was a Monday morning, well before cut off of 2 pm. It didn&#039;t mark in transit till early hours (3am -5am Tue) leaving me confused as whether it was sent it not. It didn&#039;t turn up until wed, presumably having being sent Tue. No problem, just confusing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next order I made late on this Monday night to catch the Tue delivery. Sureenough it was marked in transit early hours Tue, and landed Wednesday. I felt I had spotted a pattern!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So last night (about 2am) I made another order, hoping it would be marked in transit early this morning and arrive Fri. However it has processed all day, and marked in transit about 8pm tonight, leaving me confused whether it was sent today or will be sent tomorrow. He has also updated his page to say that processing may take 2 days due to Tor problems.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I don&#039;t know whether to miss my subs tomorrow and check drop, or wait till Saturday.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its a minor gripe really, maybe he likes to change up transit times to throw off LE. I&#039;m just used to a late afternoon &#039;in transit&#039; meaning it will come tomorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also he has stopped doing his .2 bags it seems. At just over £20 these were fucking top value for such good gear. You can buy two 0.1 samples but that&#039;s closer to £30 and not such a bargain. I don&#039;t often have £50-£60 to throw on gear, but £20 odd is always double. Bring back .2 bags All Drugs! Make an old junky very happy!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Got message from AD explaining&nbsp; it went in postbox at &#039;in transit &#039; time but obviously post will not be collected until today. (I don&#039;t think I&#039;m giving too much away by mentioning it goes in a postbox at some point during the day or night but mods please delete if so!) so that&#039;s that mystery cleared up..... Kind of disappointed because I&#039;m used to interpreting &#039;in transit&#039; as &#039;your drugs ll be there tomorrow&#039;. I guess I&#039;ve become one of those spoilt buyers who &#039;think this is fucking ebay&#039; Not ADs fault and did I mention his gear is fucking awesome.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Actually, SR vendors usually get my stuff to me much quicker than either EBay or amazon.

Once I cut down to about 4 mg I could feel it after maybe 48 hrs. Now I&#039;m down to 2mg I can miss a dose and get high, but it takes a lot more than it would.....I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s tolerance from the subs or blocking but I have to cane it round the foil to feel it usually. I&#039;ve been tempted to start hitting again, but the time I did it frightened me how quickly I got obsessed with the pins. After I finished the gear I started hitting up my subs for a day or two until I thought &#039;fuck this&#039; and now I just stick to smoking it again. Other than that I stopped using pins about 6 years ago and I can honestly say I&#039;ve had so much more control over my habit, even before I started on the subs.

Plus if you miss even a little they will bruise you up to fuck. I wouldn&#039;t waste veins on em to be honest. I had subutex by the way, I imagine suboxone would give you a lovely orangy taste in the mouth. If you want my honest advice don&#039;t bother. Stick to your sublingual subs and if you want an occausiinal treat you&#039;ll need to taper down to 2mg.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its worth mentioning that I stuck to my subs and nowt else for four years....until I discovered SR! Subs really do work if you are into getting clean but I guess that&#039;s not why we are in this thread :-).<br /><br /><br />+1 on All drugs UK....enjoying a .2 of his excellent gear right now (sorry CLK!)<br />All we need now is the .2/.2 rock/smack party pack and the UK hard drugs SR experience will be complete.

				Afternoon all, in the current disappearance of the #4 market in the UK again i was wondering if or how hard it is to refine #3 to number #4?<br /><br />A chemistry mate of mine believes it should be much harder then say converting coke to crack but I&#039;m not so sure and unless had an actual procedure to follow would be uncomfortable insufflating something i have made as my chemistry is OK at best! <br /><br />So has anyone tried this and been successful? How much do you loose from the #3 to the salts of #4? and how would you as i presume you will have to clean the #3 first, as in which chemicals? <br /><br />I think this is a lot harder to do then i have been lead to believe but would love to hear i am wrong so any advice or experience would be appreciated!

				Yeah All drugs is top gear at moment. At those prices its a bit dearer than street but the quality makes it more than worthwhile. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had a bit of a disaster today. Got my .2 this morning and threw it on foil,smoked a good few lines, nicely high. Normally I&#039;ll store my tube and foil in a DVD&nbsp; case (the sleeve note clips hold the foil nicely.) but today I knew I was going with missus and sister in law for a pub lunch, so I needed a pocket sized kit. I decided to use an empty subutex box, ideal size. Folded over edges of foil in case beetle came loose.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While waiting for main course I decided a liitle toot might be in order. The toilets in this older pub are ideally suited for private tooting, not cubicles but actual seperate rooms. I ensconsed myself in one of these black and white tiled chambers and unwrapped my foil platform, tube in mouth.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hang on.....WHERES THE FUCKING BEETLE? It had been a nice sized blob, now there was only a vague outline. The beetle had detached itself and crumbled into fragments. I frantically examined the box and pocket but no joy. My heart was beating and I began to feel like I was instantly&nbsp; withdrawing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few fragments were lurking in the folded edges of the foil, but the larger pieces were to he found on the (fortunately clean and dry) toilet floor. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its at times like these, as you scrabble on the floor of a pub toilet for pieces of heroin that you begin to question the sequence of decisions and life choices that led to this sorry situation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately I was able to salvage and reconstitute most of it, but it began to frazze soon after, far sooner than expected, and I couldn&#039;t help but attribute this to its visit to the toilet floor. Bad times.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily my tube was generously encrusted and having just smoked that I&#039;m having difficulty focussing to type this.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further bad news is that AD has taking his listings down for now, so no more cheap high quality gear. The other vendors have some pretty decent gear at competitive prices (seeds and stuff being my second choice) but its not as good as ADs stuff which is pretty specials. Top notch is also great despite choccytaste but on a break too. Any other recommendations?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insuffalating No. 3: I have had some success with snorting small lines of No 3 in past. you get a nice creeping rush. Be careful though as you can OD using this method specially in combo with benzos.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Running gear on foil is a pleasant ritual though. I&#039;ve seen some people claim they get more by &#039;spotting&#039; : putting a little out on foil at a time and frazzling it but this seemed a waste to me as you want to vaporize your gear, not burn it!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What about hitting rock with gear for that bell ringer effect? Rocks taste nice smoked but that sickening rush you get from hitting up a crack/smack combo is pretty memorable.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be careful with that GHB&nbsp; CLK, its easy to start redosing 24/7 and enter a world of pain. When you could get GBL legal in UK me and my friends got fucked up good and proper with having unlimited access to GHB. Its not a good drug for those of us with poor impulse control! Messy messy times.

				Yeah I started doing that, partly because my lung capacity isn&#039;t what it was. Its better to have a bit of room to spare in your lungs so you can suck in a bit and hold the smoke in longer. Definitely get more off your gear that way, especially if you&#039;ve got time to take it slow.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll normally have a foil 6&quot; x 4&quot; and run it end to end, but like you say do kind of half lines each time.

I just hate towards the end when your like &#039;its gonna frazzle......its going......just tease it abit further....oh fuck its gone.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Then its tube time....anyone else favour the pointy tube? You fold it kind of like a paper aeroplane before rolling it round a hexagonal pencil/pen. The point and the grooves seem to make it collect more. Usually get a good few lines off it. Swings and roundabouts I suppose though its not like its appeared by magic.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh well just tormenting myself cos gears run out and back on the subs for me for now. Always have a little binge after a piss test but I think shows over now. Feeling kinda shitty this morning so I take extra subs which has the bonus effect of preventing me getting any more gear for a few days at least.&nbsp; Got a few vallys to tide me over the transition back to normality. <br />&nbsp;

I&#039;m on 2.4 subutex at the moment and can get high after missing a morning dose.

The quality was very good,it all came about after the quacks fucked up my script. So I had a rattle on, but One ten bag held me for 24hrs, it ran lovely and was a great high. I just wondered if any street gear users had noticed an improvement in the bags around now, or is it still&nbsp; hit and miss ?(If its a SR order, half a G of UK gear last me 2 days, &amp; C63&#039;s 3 days) Which seems to make the street gear much better value.<br />My TOR Browser bundle fucked up after an update and Iwas off line for what seemed like ages. I now have TAILS with persistent volume, I am getting on in years now and am not in any way a techy. It took me 3 days to get it working but it is great now. <br />Sorry for the long post, babble babble, Sunday Morning no gear but lots of weed &amp; subbies so I am quite High.<br />C <br /><br />&nbsp;Has any body tried Dispaters new gear?? <br />C

				Yeah, the local the quality had skyrocketed with some dealers. I got off a different guy to what i had before, but the gear was lovely stoney gouchy high. First time i got some i imagined it was gonna be same as the bash that had been round for the last year n a half, so i put .25 n .25 of white in a pin, banged it up and went straight over as soon as the white has worn off! Hes had consistently good stuff for months, and the price isnt bad at all, its why i ended up going on subs.

				@ hungry &amp; isall, When i first started smoking i actually did that, put a spot on and do a tiny line till it frazzled. It does work, and can be good for nerbs to smoking cause otherwise theyd waste a hell of a lot. But once i put a proper amount out on the foil, and saw how much longer it lasted, and how much mroe i got for my money.. god i love everything about gear! Pretty wasted today, so i&#039;m craving ta fuuuck. Amazingly one of the things i miss most (pther than that IV rush) is the taste of it when smoking off foil, its lovely, and the whole routine.. mmm<br /><br />Aye i kknow about the ghb risks, i did a month or so 24/7 dosing on GBL when it was legal here, gets you hooked real fast and having to redose 5 times a night to get some kip, cause after you knock yourself out on it you wake up again on the dot 2.5hrs later cause of the domapine rebound effects.. nasty stuff, rattled off it n didnt touch it since. Nah i just got it to come down with from the various cokes i&#039;m getting, since opiates won&#039;t work for it, and i&#039;ve abused benzos to the point of uselessness for comedowns. I gotta say aswell, coming off a real benzo habit is much much harder than any rattle i ever had to do, even worse than when i took naltrexoone after a opiate session cause i was so fucked i forgot id even done it. The precip wds from that were torture.. ugh. And coind off benzo habit was still wose.. glad i&#039;m nto hooked on them again<br /><br />Anyways i&#039;m rambling, happy hunting folks! &amp; @Greg - id try a small line of the #3 youd get before dissolved it in citric etc, se how you get on. Its pretty effective, not as good as smoking or IV but better than any other ROA. If you aint satisfied then go ahead with the dissolving in citric.. Though wouldnt it be better to do the solution with vit c/Ascorbic acid? Because they&#039;re much less acidic/corrosive etc and would be a nicer final product to use :)

				Yeah the first time I ever had gear I must have been about 17 and we used to score weed of this punk guy with a habit. Eventually we mithered him into scoring us some gear. We got it back to my mates bedroom, and one of us who claimed to be an expert said you put it on foil and burnt it wit a lighter underneath. I had a fivers worth (and this must have been early 90s so a ten bag was pretty decent. I had a glass funnel and hoovered the whole fivers in one frazzle and filled my young healthy lungs. I was instantly extremely fucked and nauseous… but when I led down I was more content than I&#039;d ever been before. I think I knew then I was going to have a long relationship with this substance.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charas, I haven&#039;t actually tried the street gear near me recently. It might be fantastic. I have a close mate(you know one I grew up with) who is still into gear and so I could get him to score and trust him, but I&#039;m kind of worried that if I end up where I can just pop out with a tenner on a whim and score a bag it wouldn&#039;t be good for me! With SR you have to plan a bit in advance, get a bit of cash together, buy coins and wait a day or two. It stops that kind of &#039;fuck it its been a hard day I could have a bag in front of me in twenty minutes&#039; impulse. So it helps me not slip back into a habit. I&nbsp; have been tempted to go and show him some of the nice gear I got off SR though. Weirdly the few mates I&#039;ve mentioned it to don&#039;t seem that interested. Not sure they believe its real or something.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing the same though, the subs I don&#039;t take while I&#039;m smoking gear I use to top up the day after. I&#039;m finding it works pretty well. A few Valium take the edge off. Been doing quite a few of them since I found SR too. Wary of getting a benzo habit but I find I can binge on em for a couple of weeks then taper off them in a few days quite easily. While they are addictive they don&#039;t have that craving you get with gear. You feel shit if you stop taking them too suddenly but they don&#039;t creep up on you like gear does. You know where you only have it at weekends but then one Wednesday its a special occasion.....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have asked the drug treatment place to pause me at 2.4 for a few months. I just wish they&#039;d give up the constant low grade pressure to come off completely. You just want to tell them &#039;look I&#039;m an opiate addict, I have been a long time but I can manage it quite happily with the proper combination of meds. Just stop with the idea that your job ain&#039;t done until I&#039;m completely drug free. Because ill be fucking back here in a year having fucked up my loved ones again.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ahh my first time, few lines off the foil and i spent the next 3 hours puking my guts up, i&#039;ve never thrown up so much in my life! Makes me wonder why i persevered.. its a hell of an acquired taste though<br /><br />Be careful with the benzos pal, it seems you&#039;ve got the right idea but because they dont get ya fucked and are just a nice addition to the day, a habit can creep right up on you, i was hooked on em for 7 years and lost my marbles completely whilst detoxing

				^Not a bad idea!

Also, for real bang for your buck and from a 100% trusted seller, get the &#039;synthetic heroin&#039; from SunWu, fent mixed with lactose/mannitol, its incredibly cheap, pure and brilliant value for money. Has anyone here tried it &amp; can report back? OR just on regular fent, its not an opi i&#039;ve tried, got some on the way but itl mean detoxing off the subbys for a bit

Mind you my worker doesn&#039;t even look that closely at mine these days, pretty sure I had faint smack and benzo lines on last one, I was definitely borderline but diluted it by drinking lots&nbsp; of water on day.<br />I think if you have a court mandated one the standards are probably a lot stricter.

				Well lucky old me got my letter from s and s this morning containing the .25 of gear plus a very healthy sample of rock. It was fairly powdery, I guess due to stealth requirements, but I got out a nice simple metal hash pipe (you know the kind you can get for a couple of quid from any head shop, that screws to bits, with a picture of bob Marley on it.) I like these for rock as they are totally air tight and you get a hot blast straight to your lungs. I reckon the sample was easy .2 so thanks seeds and stuff ! I split it into four pipes, amassed a nice healthy bed of ash and hit the pipe.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve not had any rock for a while so the effects were pretty pleasant! I lay back and made a few traditional cheek blowing noises like &#039;phew…&#039; and enjoyed the rush. I would say this is decent crack and it did the job nicely! I would definitely buy this stuff off him (when my budget allowed… the trouble with rock is its over so quickly and then you feel this intense sadness and desire for more!).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gear seems pretty tasty this time too so all in all a pleasant lunch break!<br />What more can I say, I am not a crack expert so you will have to wait for some more considered judgements, but it got me very&nbsp; nicely high and euphoric&nbsp; and I want some more!

Only 1 i made on sunday arrived tuesday, i&#039;m half starting to think the mail man had clocked on and is stealing my fucking gear! haha<br /><br />When noone arrived this morning i thought fuck it and tried to get a few stones, but the only half decent number i have (also the only drug one i kept) is cut off, he musta changed it! Fff :&#039;(<br /><br />Be patient guys the sample of stone is free he can take as long as he likes to ship it :) nagging him will just convince the guy not to do samples again

				Yeah I used to do a fair bit of speed in combination with pills for going out dancing in early nineties (god the thought of me dancing now! I was a bit more slinky then!) But the gurning comedown was always nasty, and a bit of brown always helped. Its weird because my group of mates went from weed&gt;smack and only later got into the ravey stuff. Coke passed me by pretty much, but like I say, with stimulants its like the come down just got closer and closer to the start each time until now if I were to be offered a line of coke I&#039;d turn it down.<br />(Actually who the fuck am I kidding, I&#039;d hoover it up and then spend the next hour chewing my lips and feeling paranoid. I have turned down Es several times recently though when round my mates for a couple beers and a spliff. I have kids and I just couldn&#039;t deal with the comedown the next day. Plus my Mrs would leave me and take kids with her!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I have downers mostly, because they are actually useful tools for dealing with the many stresses of my life. I have to be strict with myself though because I&#039;ve got a lot to lose these days. If I were to have rock it&#039;d be an occaisional treat.&nbsp; I can smoke a pipe toot a bit of brown and get back to work.&nbsp;

				+1 for me, i used to love any and every stimulant, until the highs got lower and the lows got lower, i swear i&#039;m coming down an hour after a fat bomb of MDMA:(, also the comedowns became completely unmanagable, this was before i properly got onto gear and valium didn&#039;t touch it.. then i experienced the beauty of downers, and i&#039;ve never looked back (well, i have a peek every now and then)<br /><br />With this stone since i cant use gear to come down from it, i&#039;ll probably smoke/shoot it before i take my subbys, even if not 200mg of crack is more than managable :). It might just be me, but i&#039;ve really often found crack a huge waste of money, once or twice its got me just right, but mostly i find the rush mediocre, i&#039;d feel better off a massive line of mephedrone.. But then i was never really too much into stone, just gear gear gear<br /><br />But aye, it seems to be the way with most who carry on after party days, stims gradually changing to downers, which are much much nicer but come with the cost of an addiction heh. Though there are plenty of phet heads, god hardcore speed junkies are a complete wreck<br /><br />Oh thats just reminded me actually, i have maybe 50mg of extremely high purity speed (a 40mg bomb kept me rushing all day), and i&#039;ve never actually IVd speed before, whats the rush/high like? Is it worth a shot just this once, since i&#039;ve only got this tiny bit lying around? Would love to hear what the rush and after effects/overall high is like from one of you guys, you seem to be on the same wavelength drug-wise

				I got a 0.25 of his brown, next day delivery.&nbsp; Good to have next day domestic as ADUK and TN are down.&nbsp; TN particularly whilst he has good decent value domestic gear, he seems to have lost the consistency of when he started and seedsnstuff seems to be filling those boots for when ur needing sthing to tick you over.<br /><br />The gear runs well but has a sour taste to it.&nbsp; It is decent value for domestic so I am happy with my purchase and will use again.&nbsp; I would say it is weaker than TN&#039;s chocolate batch which in turn is weaker than ADUK&#039;s.&nbsp; Hard for me to quantify but if c63 is an 8.5, TN is a 6.5 and seeds is a 5.5.&nbsp; What you guys reckon?<br /><br />Think we are all grateful to see a domestic guy doing next day and 0.25 for a decent price.&nbsp; Sure strong gear would be great but I dont expect UK gear to be strong so shop in Asia/Holland for that. ;)

				ADUK is back up, however I was favourably impressed with the latest bag off seeds. The powder seemed a darker colour in the bag, and it gave a nice dark beetle without that red tinge. I think I&#039;d rate it higher than TNs chocolate stuff. I think that seemed stronger because it burned up quicker and tasted harsher, so you&#039;d get more gear with each toot, but it wouldn&#039;t run as far. I think ADs has the slight edge for strength but Seeds is&nbsp; more reliable for next day, and the bags are a bit bigger. I think all three are reliable sources who I can order off and be confident I&#039;ll be happy with what I&#039;ll get.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dispater and Beston3 I have less experience with, and when I ordered off them I was still on over 4mg of subutex, so it was difficult for me to judge the effects properly. I&#039;d be interested to hear what their current offerings were like<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jimmy Boyles mid stuff was a lovely bit of gear and not that much more pricey. He only does .5s though, and being on the low dose subs, I find I can do a .2 bag in a day and resume normal subs the next day with no ill effects. The two/three day binge of a .5 or a g I find is harder to adjust back to my subs, and anyway, I don&#039;t like diverting that much money to what is basically my dirty little secret. 20 odd quid every week or so I can square with my conscience.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shit its good to have some good UK gear available on SR. When I started there was maybe one or two, neither of whom were very reliable or consistent in quality.

				Another good development I&#039;ve noticed recently is sellers on localbitcoins selling about 10% cheaper than the &#039;official&#039; rate. Not so long ago it was the other way about.&nbsp; I guess a lot of vendors are using it to cash out and so will sell to the professional middlemen cheap, and competition keeps them passing on the savings to small time buyers like me. I suppose as long as they can sell the coins for more than they paid for them the current rate doesn&#039;t matter much to them

				Yeah bittylicious which i use from time to time for convenience (they work fast) used to be £10-15 over the silk road exchange, now its 2 or 3 quid over and local bit coins seems to actually be cheaper!

				ahh man, i had a little fright on localbitcoins this morning. i was up early trying to get my coin quick so i could get my orders done in time for todays post. i made a transaction to one seller but he still hadn&#039;t responded in like 45 minutes. so i cancelled him and moved onto another. he answered pretty quick and told him i was transferring the 100 quid now. i did the bank transfer and marked payment complete. and then i waited, and waited, for like 10 minutes. i&#039;ve never waited more than two before my btc were in my wallet. so i messaged him to ask if he got the payment and waited for the reply. suddenly it showed a notification and i clicked it assuming it was him messaging me back. the first thing i read on the screen of the next page was &#039;transaction cancelled by seller&#039;. i felt my heart drop into my stomach proper when i immediately realized i had sent the transfer and was too late to stop it. i&#039;m like wtf, messaging the seller and asking wtf he was doing etc. i sent about 4 messages to him and even contacted resolution before i realized the transaction that was cancelled was referring to the previous one from the guy who i waited 45 minutes for. it seriously had me going there for a minute. i know i didn&#039;t read the screen properly but i reckon localbitcoin do need to format their site a bit better. still i defo noticed its cheaper to buy coin from there lately, i often end up with more cash worth of coin in my sr wallet than i actually bought, which is awesome.

				Got mine this morning, along with an order of coke i placed at like 3 or 4 pm. Jesus this vendor is quick off the mark! 20 hrs or so to my door!<br /><br />Not tried the coke yet, which from other reports i&#039;m sure is great. The stone though, its not fantastic, but its not bad. Pretty average UK crack, nice buzz for 5 mins but nothing really special. Still it was a free sample, so cant complain at all! Highly reccomend this vendor. Got roughly 1 fat pipe left, half temped to shoot it instead of smoke it but i&#039;m planning to pin the coke later<br /><br />Cheers Seeds and Stuff! :D

				Aye just finished it off, its good but not great. I&#039;ve never been a huge crack fan tbh though, dunno if its just the way i&#039;m wired up but i never really get that fable &#039;incredible unbeatable&#039; rush, i get a rush, a nice rush, but iv had better of oral or IV MDMA or even a huge line of mepohedrone while my friends are selling their businesses just to buy more and more stone. So it probably is just the wya im wired up, and im pretty thankful for that tbh im bad enough on gear! but yeah, pretty nice rush for sure, would go nice with a bit of gear if it was listed at a reasonable price SnS!<br /><br />

				Wow. Ignore my reviews, i actually think i got them mixed up, what a fucking waste! I smoked all of what i thought was crack and got a average buzz, then went to cook up what i thought was the coke, and it wouldnt dissolve, hardly at all even with a whole bag of citric. Maan i wasted them both, only got myself to blame though. I smoked a biut of the damp crack out of the spoon and got a rush, so i def got them mixed upo. fucks sake. :&#039;(

				Anyone else waiting on All Drugs to process? He put his listings back up Wednesday morning. I ordered a .2 off him on Thursday morning then realised he hadn&#039;t logged in since putting listings up. (I should of stuck with seeds and stuff but I only had .3 btc in my account which was enough for AD but not quite for seeds) I knew he takes a bit longer which is why I ordered on Thursday morning hoping&nbsp; he would mark in transit thurs night (he always seems to put in transit overnight meaning it doesn&#039;t actually get sent till following day) and arrive Saturday, when I want it for. But he didn&#039;t log back in until late thurs, when he posted on his page he would work through the backlog and get everyone posted on Friday. This morning (according to discussion) all the wed orders are in transit but my thurs morning is still processing. I am hoping he doesn&#039;t mark it in transit this evening meaning it will sit in a post box all weekend and not come till Tuesday. I get the whole &#039;this ain&#039;t eBay&#039; thing, but most of the UK smack vendors have a cut off time and they&#039;ll get it to you next day. I&#039;m just wishing he hadn&#039;t put his listings back up on Wednesday morning if he wasn&#039;t ready to start processing until Thursday night. Id have gone and got another fiver off local bitcoins and gone with seeds and stuff if I&#039;d known.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously if he gets it in post today ill be eating some humble pie but I&#039;m getting fed up of checking and seeing &#039;processing&#039;. I keep telling myself to forget about it, it&#039;ll come when it comes but you know what it&#039;s like.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We really need a third category.<br />&quot;Awaiting action&quot; for before vendor has seen order, and buyer can cancels<br />&quot;Processsing&quot; when vendor is packing etc. there could be a limit on how many can be marked processing at once, to prevent vendors just marking all orders straight away.<br />&quot;In transit&quot; as normal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve proposed this in the past but you just get shouted down&nbsp; by vendors saying &quot;yeah but people would just be cancelling after I licked a stamp and everything&quot;(having not read or fully understood the proposal.)<br />Vendors work really hard I get it, but it is annoying when you are stuck with one vendor who is too busy when you know there are at least two or three others who would deliver by tomorrow.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s like if I ring a street dealer and he says &#039; twenty minutes mate&#039; then switches his phone off for three days, at least my twenty quid isn&#039;t tied up waiting for him, I can go elsewhere.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And All Drugs if you are reading this I DO NOT MEAN THAT I WANT TO CANCEL! It&#039;s too late now to go elsewhere, just please hurry! Thanks

				Aye its dissolved in the past, but this stuff barely would , even with a full bag of cirtic _.. weird. Shot up some phet instead so the day aint a total loss, but fuck what awaste of money on the coke just to bang it on a pipe and smoke it. No wonder i didnae get much off it!<br /><br />Aye i agree with you, a lot of vendors change it to shipping or whatever its called when its not at all. Packages take ages to be delivered, except for BounceToBass and Seeds And Stuff. Theyv been the only 2 with 100% good communication and honest shipping times. But i cant see how an extra catagory would help, itd be the miorty of vendors who would change anything about how often they lie about it being shipped..

				The extra category means you can cancel and get your money back if a vendor goes AWOL after you&#039;ve placed your order, or doesn&#039;t show any sign of having noticed it.Obviously there would still be good vendors and bad vendors. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not particularly slagging All Drugs off, I just was hoping to get it for Saturday and now it looks like its going to be next week<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I&#039;d been able to cancel this morning I prob would of, as he only seems to mark in transit at night, it wouldn&#039;t have been any skin of his nose and I could have gone to Seeds and stuff instead.

				Yes, every time... He marks in transit overnight and I asked him about it and he said yes I posted it then, it&#039;ll be collected in morning. Which means it doesn&#039;t come till day after. Most vendors will mark in transit early evening and that means &quot;I got it in before last post for you, expect tomorrow.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am currently in this position as, knowing his usual time taken, ordered Thursday morning hoping to get Saturday. He marked in transit about 4pm today. I hope this means it&#039;ll be there tomorrow (made last post) but I won&#039;t be missing my subs in the morning in expectation, it makes the wait seem too long if there is possible disappointment. If it comes well and good, I&#039;ll save it for Sunday. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If not it won&#039;t get here till Tuesday will it? As you say it might be good gear but I could have ordered it from NL myself in same time. We will see. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ll be tempted to stick to Seeds and Stuff, or Top notch&nbsp; if so, there gear might not be quite as good but it does the job fine for me and they never fail to deliver. Seeds in particular is really good to deal with.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or jimmy Boyle if he ever comes back!

				I know but a) as far as the missus is concerned I don&#039;t dabble and if she found&nbsp;out then all hell would break loose.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) if I was on methodone there really would be no barrier to me using as much as I wanted.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like at the moment if I do a bag a bit too often and feel shitty after, my first thing to do is take a larger dose of subs, which makes me feel better and also blocks gear for a few days until I get the dose. down again. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With methodone in that circumstance you can take can larger dose and actually get a bit high which can set you penduluming and actually make things worse.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am uncomfortably aware that its getting more often though. I&#039;m also aware that this current period is like a grace period, its working pretty well for me, 2.4 subs is just right so i can dabble one day and still itll hold me the next. but if&nbsp; I proceed with the subutex taper and carry on doing gear I&#039;m just going to end up with a habit. I mean obviously I still got an opiate habit but I mean a heroin one. I&#039;ve got a sizeable stash of subs saved up, and if I do continue to dabble I&#039;ll stick to only buying .2 s and having a couple of valleys after to ease back in.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be honest before my four year period where I did nothing but subs I managed to dabble fairly successfully for a few years, mostly by&nbsp; being shit scared of getting another habit! I never want to end up in that waking up every day with the countdown ticking. You hit up and turn the hour glass over but always the sands running out. If I found myself heading back that way I would just ask to be out back on subs before it got out of control.

				<br />Hi <br />I&#039;ve ordered a few times from ADUK, Opium ans Smack every order has taken 2 days, 1 took 3.<br />Which as said is no qucker than a C63 order and a lot dearer. <br />&nbsp;On the subject mentioned of subs and Mathedone. A few weeks ago, the DRs fucked up my script so I did not get my script for a few days. I went into panic mode once the Chemist said &#039;you pick up is suspended&#039;.<br />I had to chase an old friend, he gave me a few 100ml of Methedone and a few 10 bags of Brown.<br />I am on 2.4 Subs, I had not had any for 36 hrs, I thought 5 or 10 ml of Meth would hold me easily! 60ml later I was still ill. I did not take any more, I stuck with the Brown for 3 days &amp; a ten bag held me for 24hrs. <br />I never got on with meth when using too, I found it blocked the &#039;nice &#039; effects from the Gear,&nbsp; and I can smoke a ton and not get off on it, now I can take the 2.4mg subbies at 4 or 5 am and by the time I get home from work at tea time I can get wrecked off a small bag of gear with no problem the next day going back to the subs, even if I binge for a few days, I might have to up the subs dose but it is really quite easy to get back stable on the subs. So for me Subutex beats Methedone hands down. <br />When I was younger I had been on Meth for over Ten years, I had a script for Amps and Physeptone&nbsp; tablets, I was on sugar free for a while, we used to boil that down a bang it up, that was in the days when UK addicts were dealt with at the Psychiatric part of the hospital. I did a complete stop after working down from about 75ml to about 25ml I stopped dead! The rattle went on for Months!! If I remember right, It started in early September and was still not &#039;right&#039; at Xmas, I went weeks with practically no sleep. <br />I never want to do that again, and although I have not done a Subs detox yet, it could not possibly be as bad as a Methedone rattle. The fucking stuff was the Nazis invention and was used in their camps as Method one you can guess what for. <br /><br />I have only subbies for a week and have not had a smoke for over a week, &amp; I&#039;m hanging out for a toot.<br />I hope you are all in a better situation than me.<br />Take care every one.<br /><br />C

				Yeah, 2 or 2.4 mg seems to be about the magic dose for subs, from what I&#039;ve read it&#039;ll hold most people , even with full on H habits. The only reason it gets prescibed at such high doses is a) drug treatment agencies are staffed by well intentioned lovely people who haven&#039;t a fucking clue. b) the higher doses effectively block illicit opiate use for up to a week, making it very effective at keeping addicts on meds. and c) in america, where many junkys won&#039;t have health insurance and must pay $100s for their scripts, a bunch of 8mg pills won&#039;t cost much more than a bunch of 2mg ones, so kind doctors prescribe the 8s with a wink, knowing the script will last the addict longer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trouble us that the workers at my place, having read all the literature from the drug companies, believe that buprenorphine withdrawal is much easier than heroin, and that 2 mg is basically an insignificant dose. I have been urged to &#039;jump off&#039; and take a &#039;medicine called lofexedine, which isn&#039;t an opiate but will alleviate your symptoms&#039;( I know what lofexidine us you patronising student doctor, I have seen your kind come and go over and over, and I&#039;m not taking that horrible shit again)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eyebrows are raised at my proposal to slowly taper to .1 mg of subutex and knowing looks exchanged. They&#039;ve heard about this psychological addiction. Best humour him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would dearly love these doctors to be made to take 2mg of subutex daily for a few&nbsp; months and then tell me about psychological addiction.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its like the doctor I heardon the radio&nbsp; explaining his research had shown that heroin addiction was largely in the head, and the WDs were little more than mild flu. &#039;They just like taking it&#039; All doctors who make&nbsp; such statements should be forcibly injected with heroin four times a day for three months and then have their dose replaced with placebo saline. If they are correct they won&#039;t notice the difference.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure whether to just insist to my drug workers that I stay at this convenient dose of 2.4. The agency is going through one if its regular management changes. I feel sorry for the staff really. On the one hand they have their clients constantly lying and disappointing them and kicking off because they spent the last three days smacked up and didn&#039;t bother to collect their script and now its been cancelked . on the other hand they are getting constant pressure from above to meet constantly changing targets.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still I may be able to turn the confusion to my advantage. On the other hand I might get some hard line dick head who is like &#039;you have fannied around long enough my freind&#039; which in fairness I have.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The way this governments drug policy is heading I may end up getting sent to some kind of reeducation centre&nbsp; and getting electric shock based aversion therapy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Couple of years ago there was some talk of a program called &quot;intuitive recovery&quot;. I looked at the site and it was just a load of NLP, self help bullshit about how basically there is no such thing as addiction, &#039;addicts&#039; just like taking drugs because they are pleasurable. So addicts just need to stop taking drugs. I declined to attend but what angered me is that the council was paying hundreds of quid per client to these fraudsters. The drug treatment centre is already woefully underfunded and my council tax was been given to these dickheads.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;( I do pay council tax plus am being made to pay for all the years where I didn&#039;t pay ie most of my adult life. The council tax never give up and they ask ways find you eventually. All other forms of debt can be ignored and will eventually give up, in my experience. Lucky for me! Oh and court fines will get round to you eventually too.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway had my subs this morning and if All Drugs defys my expectations and delivers I&#039;ll save it till tomorrow. Unlike crack, I can save H as long as I&#039;m not rattling.<br /><br /><br />Incidentally Charas, is opium any good? I have been tempted but worry that basically I&#039;ll be getting weaker, unrefined heroin and will wish I bought smack instead. Its like all those American opiates; oxys and whatnot. I&#039;d like to try them but cant believe they are worth the prices.

				Well I&#039;d like to retract all statements relating to All Drugs as he got me bag to me this morning. That&#039;s 2 day delivery which is the same as the last couple of orders off him. It&#039;s obviously just how his procedure works. Having said that if he could offer next day delivery he would clean up. I will continue to use Seeds and Stuff though as his stuff is not far off in quality.and his customer service is something special. and top notch when he returns for some chocolatey goodness.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I&#039;m stuck with a lovely bag of gear which I can&#039;t touch till tomorrow.(I&#039;ve not actually experimented with using the same day I had my 2.4 mg sub, but I know if I put it out ill just cane it all and wish I&#039;d waited.) Still, Missus is working all day and all night tomorrow so that&#039;ll be me with my feet up tooting at my leisure.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just wanted to add I thought seeds crack was fine. About what I&#039;d expect from good street stuff but with the advantage of being a proper weighed amount instead of some dipped travesty. Get it listed and I can waste some money on a drug that lasts ten minutes at best! Aaah crack you bastard. I don&#039;t even like you but I want you right now. Not like good old reliable heroin, my trustworthy friend and companion. At least you give a fair deal. It&#039;s selling your soul but getting a fair price.

				Hey HG <br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t know which part the country you are from, but I&#039;m getting the same shit from my Drug workers, at CDT, Aquarius, Pathways or whatever the fuck they are calling it this week. Jump off with Lofexidene (sp?)<br />&amp; that 2mg is not really doing anything!! They should see me if I don&#039;t have any for 36hrs, Cunts they are at those places. I have used them for way to long, I even had a lesbian couple that used to ring up to try to score for their new client who would not be able to see a Dr till after weekend, &amp; then it turned out to be for themselves. <br />I would love to be able to get away from the whole thing and manage my own habit, but at the moment it just is not practicable or affordable, I saw a 2mg on SR selling for £11 round here you can get 7x8mg for 10 or 20 quid, depending on how much they want their next stone.<br /><br />I have not been able to order for week, and can&#039;t for another week yet, &amp; I am hanging out for a smoke, got plenty of subs &amp; weed, but it aint the same with out a toot.<br /><br />&nbsp;My mrs will have her share of freebase/crack, so I can get away with a come down bag , trouble is that bag is usually 2 or 3 half G&#039;s all ordered together so I will be almost guaranteed to have some when the coke/crack arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;Oh and I had not had Opium since I was a kid and wanted to try some, but I would not bother again, I just kind of got a sicky heavy feeling. I will stick to the Brown it is MUCH better value.<br /><br />Sorry for the long post, I just smoked a spliff and am a bit babbley<br />Take care<br />C<br />

				Well am back again after another bit of a break had work commitments and shit and I find reading this forum is too temting when ur trying to stay shy of d gear hahah.<br />But it would seem i choose good time to return managed to bag what i assume to be last samle of seeds and stuffs crack and bought a .25 bag of his H. I have to say I usually only order off c63 but i did try top notchs chocolatey stuff and I think this gear is at least on par with that. Also comms where a 100% from the vendor which I think makes a good differance.<br /><br />As for the crack I&#039;ll just be honest and say it was my first time trying it so cant compare it, however, i would occassionaly smoke a bit of crystal and have snorted my fair share of coke in the day, anyway, I definitely enjoyed the crack too and would be temted to order it again at some point in the future, however, it would only likely be very occassionally.<br /><br />Overall I think ill be using seeds and stuff fairly often in future if I just want a small bag of gear and I want it next day<br /><br />Hope use are all keeping safe and are doing well

				@mercurny - C63s A gear really is good, i&#039;ve had it about 4 times now, its excellent strong quality every time. it has a slight dark color to it and is very fine dusty powder. you certainly wouldn&#039;t be complaining about it tho.<br /><br />his B grade stuff is similar color but has a bit of a sugar cut to it. its still not bad gear tho, still you wouldn&#039;t complain considering the price. i would definitely give my recommendation to either of them but if you can afford then its worth getting the A grade, it is the best gear i know of on sr within the Eu and i doubt many people would argue about that.<br /><br />@latexpods - you could try alldrugsuk, he resells C63s A grade gear, i&#039;ve had that too and it really is exactly the same. he&#039;s a bit more expensive than C63 but he is domestic for me so i like the next day delivery that i get from him. C63 specifically states that he won&#039;t ship to the US, but aduk doesn&#039;t say that.

				Maybe I&#039;m being unfair to him, but the same happened to me with him (didn&#039;t log on for a couple days, meanwhile everyone who ordered stressed out, then he logged on and processed everyone , so he wasn&#039;t actually late in my case)and I was thinking, if he is reselling, and he reups, maybe he isn&#039;t buying huge amounts and so he runs out, then doesn,t bother logging in till the reup delivers; meanwhile he has collected a healthy backlog of orders.(mind you he sells multiple items so ths doesn&#039;t really fit)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Either way its annoying when a vendor goes AWOL without notice, and you make an order. The good vendors will put a big noticable update on their page warning of it. Once might be a personal emergency, but AD seems to do it as he feels like it and it makes it difficult to plan.o<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It reminds me of dealers who you ring up and they go &quot;outside tesco in 20minutes mate&quot; and you get there and there&#039;s five different junkys trying to wait inconspicuously, and five more turn up while you are waiting, and then they drive up and serve everyone at once. Of course IRL this is risky for the dealer, but doing it online is easier.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ADs gear is nice though and being fair, its always been with me in 2 days as it says on page so I guess I&#039;ve got no complaints.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its weird though, I got it Saturday and so started on it early Sunday, rather than early afternoon like usual. Whern I put it on the foil it had that smell even before I turned it, so it was top gear, but I smoked it all day and didn&#039;t really get proper nod off it.This has happened before when I start it so early so it wasn&#039;t the gear; I don&#039;t know whether its because its slightly closer to my last Sub dose (although I can&#039;t see six hours making such a big difference) or perhaps because I&#039;m trying to make it last all day. Either way I seem to have a bitch of a tolerance and 0.2 just ain&#039;t doing it anymore. I guess I think of myself as having been clean a long time but in fact I&#039;ve been on subs all that time.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking into account both quality and service, I guess Seeds would be my favourite at moment. Admittedly ADs stuff was stronger but I didn&#039;t notice a huge difference, and the unpredictasbility of AD counts heavily against him forme.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BestOn3 has small listings back up, last iI ordered off him it was when I still was on too high subs so can&#039;t reasll make judgement of him or dispater. (Also, after being messed about on local bitcoins, I was trying to make a late order at 4.30. I messaged the vendor to see if I made cut off for next day, and when I next logged on I saw he had marked in transit &quot;Nice one what a guy&quot; I thought....then I noticed the message &quot;if you FE now I will send today. Up to you&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;This pissed me off but I thought if I don&#039;t, whos to say he won&#039;t mess me about tomorrow. I should have asked to cancel (it was after last post anyway) but like a mug I FEd. The gear didn&#039;t come until day after next anyway. I can&#039;t remember whether it was dispater or beston3 who did this but it left a bad taste and I have avoided both since. Bit unfair, but the innocent suffer along with the guilty!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jimmy Boyle is back on. His mid was the best gear I have had since time immemorial. (In legal terms that refers to the reign of King Henry II, so forever realky) When you are buying .2 s and .5 s anyway it isn&#039;t much more expensive. It literally ran clear on foil for first couple of foils. Don&#039;t know if his new batch is the same but I&#039;d be inclined to trust him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a french seller offering 0.25 samples for 0.17 btc, that&#039;s like £15! Tempted to have a gamble but feedback is very few, with one &quot;this wasn&#039;t even fucking gear wouldn&#039;t cook up&quot; I&#039;ve seen similar feedback in gear I know to be good though so meh.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Won&#039;t be ordering for a week or so anyway,got some valleys coming soon (black tuna gang, decent strength and v. reliable)so gonna reduce my sub still further. I&#039;ll see whos on then. I just want a proper gouch, but I don&#039;t want to start hitting my veins again. Once you do that its hard to go back to smoking, and I do like a nice chase. Apart from the blocking, the subs seem to have set my tolerance proper high, when a .2 of nice gear only gets me feeling relaxed. I was up and down the foil like &#039;one more line one more line....OK one more, change foil, just a couple to get it started&#039; but its like I couldnt get past a certain point.. Its like the subs are still blocking somewhat. Want to see what haspoens when I reduce down to 1.5 or 1

				no i was thinking the same. as powder it just doesn&#039;t look like you got as much, plus both the 1/2 Gs i got were only .4, but he said he&#039;ll make it up on the next one. i&#039;d still like to see it as a nice rock tho, so i can compare the size to what you&#039;d get on the street.<br /><br />edit; just noticed aduk has been online today. still showing no listings tho and my order is still in processing and no reply to my message yet. we&#039;ll just have to keep watching for now.

I&#039;m sure I heard someone posting about that before. <br /><br />Well luckily I did get my order in with BO3 yesterday about 1545 just before his cut off and the packet arrived today, was quite amazed to see it so quickly. Just dumping 0.2 onto the foil as we speak. Looks like promising gear. Good stealth so yeah a good experience and would recommend him if you&#039;re in a hurry for the goods.<br /><br />So if I don&#039;t hear anything from ADUK by 2100 I&#039;ll cancel and I think i&#039;ll place an order with Jimmy Boyle and give him a try, I did want to try Seeds but he only has white listed at the moment.<br /><br />Take it easy.

				bo3 is a bit on the expensive side for a .2 for me tbh. think i&#039;d just rather spend another tenner and get c63s 1/2G, or even a whole G of his b grade.<br /><br />actually what do you all think is the best option with c63, the 1/2G of A grade or the whole G of his B grade? they are both around 40 odd quid, like £3 between them i think.

It leaves a bit of a dirty trail but it smokes nice and has a pleasant taste. What is your ROA anyway? It&#039;s not the best gear i&#039;ve had from the road but I needed something quick and BO3 came up with the goods. Out of 10 I would rate c63 last batch i tried from him about 9/10 so this about 6/10, it&#039;s not really going to set the world on fire but it&#039;s better than most stuff bought locally from the streets near me. Yes I would recommended. Hope this helps.<br /><br />Peace.

				Any recommendations on UK charlie and MDMA vendors that don&#039;t want FE? I was using Dispator for charlie and K queen for mdma but there has been some bother with k queen. First few times was great, but last time was methylone not MDMA and now they are asking everyone to FE and running with the bitcoins scamming everyone. Dispator always requires FE and whilst I&#039;ve not had an issue before I don&#039;t want to FE ever again. <br />Cheers!

				Thanks Hungary Chost just checked there to see BTG have no active listings hahah but I&#039;ll wait it out I think. Just to add for anyone wondering my c63 order was marked in transit late last night/ early hours this morning so for anyone thinking of putting in an order he seems to be running with a bit of a delay at the minute, hoefully wont be long till he is back to 100% form, however, if you can wait I normally find his gear to be worth it.<br /><br />

				c63s crack went up a few quid this morning while i was on my way to the bank to put the money in. so when i got back i turned up nearly 5 quid short. i think the btc price might have changed too while i was sorting them out. but anyway, after a palava and a half i got the coin and made an order for half g of both. just got the long wait now arrgh. hoping he posts tomorrow coz if not its gonna be monday and i won&#039;t be seeing anything prolly till the end of the week. still i know its on its way. just the short time the gear lasts doesn&#039;t compare to how long you have to wait for it lol.

				years ago i figured that the less air you have in a pipe to start the better the hit would be. so i looked for the very smallest thing i could make a pipe out of, and that was a cut off clipper lighter. i sawed the top off with a hack saw, drilled a hole in the side, put in a pipe and sealed with blutak then fitted the foil over the top with a laggy band. works fucking brilliantly. i started a bit of a craze for a while where everyone round my area were making them. i got one now i made the other week. i&#039;ll take a pic so you can see.<br /><br />here, its just the usual cigarette ash type pipe but works great.<br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/dEKf.jpg<br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/Ih6b.jpg

				As I said, I found a cheap metal hash pipe consisting of a metal bowl with a screw in metal pipe very effective, with a gauze, and a blob of ciggy ash to support the liquifying rock. Air tight and simple. My mate used to use a short right angled copper pipe (with pin poked foil and elastic band.) The clipper idea sounds like it would work well. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can get a screw fitting pipe with a picture of Bob Marley on it for couple quid at any car boot sale or head shop, strip it of any excess crap.you basically want a airtight tube long enough to stop you burning your lips.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some like the air chamber of a small panda pop bottle with a birotube stuck in it, made airtight with blutack or gum or tape. Then a foil top secured with an elastic band.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I always wanted to try a proper glass stem, where you have a tiny ball of steel wool in the end to hold the vaporizing rock, and you hear the outside of the pipe.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can probably run it on foil but you would waste a lot if you didn&#039;t time yoursuck and suck hard,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great now I want a pipe! Crack is weird. I think it has no physical addiction and never had any problem leaving it alone but just thinking about it causes a pang of intense longing for that taste. I don&#039;t even know if I find it euphoric like did the first few times, it just causes a sensation that my brain wants again. Its like when I have it I will use it compulsively till its gone and then have a few licks of brown, and I don&#039;t particularly get the urge to get more, even if it was just a phone call away. If its in front of me I&#039;ll slap tenners down until my wallets empty but its like a short term addiction.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I always feel more than one rocks a waste. You&#039;re just a gibbering fiend after first one and its hard to describe keep hitting the pipe as pleasure.

				i had one of them little metal pipes you&#039;re talking about once and it wasn&#039;t air tight at all. maybe it was just a faulty one but the thread on the screw in bit was rubbish. i could never get the whole hit cause i was getting so much air coming in. <br /><br />seriously tho guys, get an old clipper and make the pipe i showed you. its easy as fuck, takes five minutes if you have a proper hack saw and drill. just burn the fresh cut edge a little with a lighter to blunten off any sharp edges and you&#039;re good to go.<br /><br />even if you just do one pipe through it to try.<br /><br />i bet you don&#039;t only do one pipe tho.

				You are certainly right about my lack of experience with crack first time doing it was last weekend with seeds and stuffs sample. I had already smoked slightly less than about .5 of crystal meth started smoking it late night friday and didnt give crack a whirl till late enough saturday at an afterparty after a wedding but by this stage i had broke my meth pipe and so smoked it on some foil. As i said i had a mixture of success got a bit of a rush but not what i was expecting thats why I want to make sure i have clear picture in my head of what to do before c63 gear comes next week as naturally I dont want to waste his stuff.<br /><br />In terms of making a clear pipe would I be right in thinking this could be done in a similar fashion to making a shooter for weed. (Get a plastic bottle and a metal cheap stock stock then mod it by putting some metal gauze or tin foil with some small holes into the stock put some ash on top of this then the crack). Im assuming not to put water in it? <br /><br />In terms of a dose about how much of the half gram bag should i put in?<br /><br />Man i will give ur some serious likes when i am allowed to for all this help. Also I apologise for drifting from the heroin topic but I feel this is slightly related.<br /><br />Anyway thanks all

				no its the other way round for a crack pipe. you put the foil on the top of the bottle, where the stock goes you just put a bic pen tube or similar to suck the smoke through. you will hold the bottle upright at all times with a crack pipe otherwise your rock will likely roll off the ash..<br /><br />the reason for this is with weed you have the stock going into water to cool the smoke. you can&#039;t do this with crack because cocaine is water soluble and the crack will dissolve into the water before it gets to you. also the water cools the weed smoke to make it less chokey. this is unnecessary with crack because it will numb your throat as the smoke goes down and will not be chokey at all. not unless its some shit crack anyway, but it will not be the case with what you get from c63.<br /><br />the only reason for putting water into a crack pipe is if the bottle is large, then it is filled with water to below the pipe level. this is solely for the reason of reducing the space inside the bottle meaning you will need to suck less air out of the pipe before you get to the crack smoke. you do not want the smoke going through the water at all.<br /><br />it also makes it easier to set up cause like i said earlier if you tip the pipe at any time the crack will roll off the ash. this way you can sit the pipe down and lay on the ash and then place the crack on using both hands and not having to hold the pipe at an angle with one hand. it will be tricky trying to set up with only one hand. much better to have both hands free. the powdered stuff with c63 especially cause you will need to scoop it up to put on the ash.

				here, i just found a pic on google that shows you perfectly what you want. this set up would be ideal for your first go<br /><br />http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I00009JIChpad7Gg/s/750/600/Crack-Pipe-2.jpg<br /><br />one thing tho, get a small piece of blutac and work it in your fingers, stretch it out and get it nice and soft. then use it to seal around where the pen tube goes into the bottle. it is very hard to get a proper airtight seal without it.<br /><br />oh and use an elastic band around the foil where they have just put the break off part of the bottle lid. you&#039;ll just tear the foil trying to do that and elastic band is so much easier and gives 100% airtight seal.

				you know what, thinking back to the first time i ever did a pipe, a friend sorted me out with it so it was just an average size pipe. i wish for my first ever time i had bought a bit and put a whacking great lump on cause you can never get the feel of that first hit again. <br /><br />but generally if i had a .2 stone i would do it in 4, maybe five if its a nice sized one. but putting a full half of a 20 stone on, which would be about .1 does make for an awesome hit. its up to you really, a .1 on the pipe won&#039;t hurt you anymore than if you split it in two, but the rush will be absolutely fucking awesome. i&#039;m guessing if you&#039;re getting of c63 then you&#039;re getting half a G. so i&#039;d say go for it on your first and do a .1<br /><br />then switch to about half that at a time to keep topping it up. about .05 i&#039;d call an average and perfectly fine pipe usually tho, it all depends how hard you like your hit and how many pipes you want to make from what you got.

				Cheers man. Yea your spot on i bought .5. I usually place 2.5 gram orders of his strong number 3 every 2 or 3 weeks so instead this month ive opted for 1 gram strong 1 gram of his weaker number 3 (want to see what its like ) which has left me with some coinage so ive decided to buy .5 of his crack really looking forward to it now as i said with seeds and stuffs sample I managed to get a small rush but wouldnt call it a proper hit. However this was enough for me to know i would enjoy it if i did it right. Im not really surprised by this, however, as a few years ago i had a small coke habit wouldnt really clasify it as an addiction but I was certainly using it quite a lot and in rather large dosages so ive always wanted to try good crack anyway .<br /><br />Thanks again for everything man. This is what I love about this forum everyone always seems willing to help each other out where possible and also you dont get those bullshit response like you find a lot elsewhere (drug-forums im looking at you) of the dont start your a dickhead you will ruin your life etc. and your like right im a fucking adult who enjoys consuming mainly what would be classified as hard drugs, however, I am making an informed decisiona dn want to try it and so far in life as bill hicks said ive enjoy using drugs and havnt lost one fucking job or any of the other shit that people seem to associate with people using any drug other than their own paticular drug of choice&nbsp; hahah<br /><br />anyway rant over I fucking love u all peace

				you can&#039;t smoke crack alone on the foil properly. the only time i&#039;ve known anyone smoke it like that is mixed with heroin to make snowball. to get the high with the low. its just a slight bit of high you get from the crack as on the foil you are smoking it gradually like heroin. but then if it gave you too much high it would dominate the downer effect of the brown completely. its no way to smoke crack on its own.

				Aye man i kinda knew I had fucked it up once i did it but you probably know how it is i was pretty fucked up on the meth which had run out and I had this little sample of crack just looking up at me so i ended up CRACKING (pun intended) under the pressure and had to give it a a go, but sure it was&nbsp; a learning experience so hopefully come next weekend I&#039;l be able to report back with a much better experience. <br /><br />Just out of curiosity have you ever tried any crystal meth man? If so how does it compare to crack in your opinion?<br /><br />&nbsp;If you havent id say give it a go plus while your coming down a smoke of H is brilliant like just a great sense of relaxation in my opinion as the meth runs out cause you can get a lot in to your system so your sitting with great rush of the H but can kinda sit on the brink of nodding for ages haha. Id say if you use pins it would be good too but alas I am open to trying any drug but have zero intentions of ever shooting

				Aye man its definitely not a drug that you can take if you need sleep that night but like it doesnt keep you awake in that bed sense wheree like with mephedrone or speed where you at some point feel physically exhausted but when you lay in bed your heart is racing and your brain wont chill out I tend to find with meth you can be up for like 24+ hours but you still feel completely alert and physically you still feel fine, however when you do sleep you can crash for like 13 hours plus, well I do anyway.<br /><br />Good luck anyway man im going to log off here I hope you know I genuinely appreciate the info and adviice hopefully at some point I can lend a hand to you and in some way repay the favour

				actually i&#039;ve noticed quite a lot of my dutch parcels seem to turn up on a saturday. every time i&#039;ve ordered crack from c63 its always come on saturday. and i remember a couple from uglydoll did too. i&#039;m wondering if they only send dutch mail across the channel on certain days of the week, like friday being one of them. i remember ordering crack from c63 on a tuesday and it turned up saturday. the next time was a wednesday and i really expected it on monday that time but it turned up saturday as well. <br /><br />might be something in that, i&#039;m gonna look into it.

				Hi <br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for the reply CyborgUK. <br /><br />&nbsp;My order from Bo3 came this morning, the Gear gods shone on me for the first time in 2 weeks or so.<br />Yes 19hrs after putting the order in, it was on the foil!! can&#039;t do better than that.<br />The gear is pretty strong, I mean its not C63&#039;s but its up there with TN&#039;s chocolate gear. Only Bo3&#039;s gear tastes nicely of &#039;Poppies&#039; and runs pretty well on the foil. The bag was a good size, but I didn&#039;t weigh it. looking at it, I would guess its like 4 ten bags from the streets my way, so even though it is quite expensive, the quality is fine and almost being guaranteed to get it within 24hrs, for me,&nbsp; makes it well worth it. <br />&nbsp;I have smoked about a third of the bag, and even after taking my Subutex dose early this morning I can still feel it, and I am pretty stoned, by the time I do the bag in I guess I&#039;ll be well fucked...... thankfully ... &amp; my how I have missed flirting with the golden dragon.. <br />Hope you all have a great day, take care.<br /><br />C <br />

				Ah looks like ill prob order off him this week then if nothing else changes. It&#039;s annoying that I have to hide my gear use from mrs. I don&#039;t drink or do anything really apart from daily subs, but when I want to score I have to shade 10 or 20 quid here and there. (As she is all up in my business, I&#039;m self employed so get wads of cash at intervals but I rarely remember to lower the figure in advance leaving me spare ! Should do that really!) it&#039;s easy enough but it means I don&#039;t have the patience to save up the 60 quid needed for some of Jb&#039;s amazing gear and instead spend 30 on a .2 from beston3.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Talking of subs the good folk at the pharmacy managed to fuck up my script. I have been reducing .8mg a month but last time I was at the centre said &quot;hold it at 2.4 I intend to get high for a few months…I Mean just like stabilise for a bit&quot;. All appeared sorted but when I presented at chemist he gave me a weeks supply at 1.6. He also said that next month the script went back up to 2.4, so clearly part of message got through. It was a temp pharmacist so I&#039;m inclined to blame him…I have had one keep me there for 40minutes while he slowly absorbed the fact that Subutex and Buprenorphine are the same thing, and he did in fact have some of the latter in stock. You wonder how some of these idiots got a degree.&nbsp; I am continuing to amass a buffer of tabs so that if the service implodes altogether ill be able to taper on my own.

				Well I took plunge and bought a couple of bags off the street. I have a close friend who is still into the local gear scene and knows who has good stuff. I got a couple of ten bags, The gear was fairly decent (about the standard id exoecr from most UK SR sellers but the tenner bags were pretty small; this makes sense too as they have been selling ten bags for twenty years now, inflation has to take hold somewhere. These were probably closer to .1 than .2.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So its pretty much confirmed what I thought; gear on SR IS expensive but not too much.&nbsp; Mind you I&#039;ve smoked one of these bags tonight and I&#039;m having to concentrate typing, had my subs this morning too so not getting full effect. So must be pretty strong. I&#039;ll smoke the other in the morning to see.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanna get some of Jimmy Boyles stuff to show him. At 60 quid for a .5 its like £15 for a &#039;local bag&#039; and I reckon there&#039;s some pretty good strength/value ratio going in there.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This local stuff is decent tackle though, kind of reminds me of top notches(no choc taste though): bit dirty but strong. Getting a bit of a nod going now so best go to bed........

True to his word he sent it on Friday and it arrived today. :)<br /><br />I&#039;d noticed that the previous stuff was a little darker and less fine powder than before. More mid-brown and a little gritty. The really good stuff was very fine powder, almost like dust and very pale brown. I was using it at least twice as fast as before and that was down to quality, not tolerance. I weigh my stuff every day to monitor my usage and it jumped from 150-200mg/day with the good stuff to 400-500mg/day with his August restock. Not good.<br /><br />That was a huge drop in quality, did anyone else notice too? My first thought was that I&#039;d been sold C63&#039;s B quality by mistake, but he assured me that I was sent the A quality and there was no chance of a mix-up.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s history now, the new stuff is amazing, back to his previous high quality if not better!<br /><br />

Like I say I have been smoking it a long time so it aint like wen u first start off and cant get hang off chasing it. Taste i cant describe at all to be honest maybe dark and throaty hahah

				No id say it was one of the last bags of his last batch. Definitely not his new one anyway. Feel proper conflicted like because its probs the first time i&#039;ve got a bag of his gear that has dissapointed me despite usually buying at least 2.5 grams a month now for over a year. Other than the occasional few weeks pause to help prevent a proper habit developing. <br /><br />What do you all think is any point in me letting him know I was let down? Thing is I dont really think I can as I am obviously going to smoke it anyway and it has been a once off. Also I wouldnt want to come across as some dick hoping to get offered something for nothing as that just aint kinda person I am.<br /><br />Im just glad i only got 1 gram instead of my usual 2.5. The thing thats worrying me, however, is that I only got the one gram of the strong number 3 instead of my usual 2.5 as I then opted to get a bag and a half of the&nbsp; cheaper stuff so I could also get half a gram of crack. So now im panicking in case the weaker stuff is going to be more or less useless when it comes.&nbsp; Have any of you tried his cheaper gear?<br /><br />Well can any a use help advice me and any ideas a what the problem is with this particular bag?

				i dunno what was wrong with yours then but i had a few of his last batch and they were all good. really nice clean gear with nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />i also had some of his B grade and its ok for the price. it does have a noticeable sugar cut which gives it that slight amber color to the beetle, and the beetle will have a stickiness to it as a result. but its smokable for sure, just don&#039;t expect the strength of his good gear, its more akin to what you find on average on the street.

				its not unknown. i&#039;ve bought two bags off a dealer on the street a few times, or been with a mate and we&#039;ve got one each, and one of them have run fine and the other just frazzled up. sometimes when stepping on the gear its not all quite mixed up properly and you can get a lump of the cut clump together and get picked up and weighed off like all the other deals, but that deal ends up being nearly all cut. especially can happen if the step isn&#039;t shaken up properly and then its dampened and repressed.

				i&#039;m pretty certain his last stuff was cut with brown caffeine powder, which is what gave it that darker than usual color. brown caffeine powder looks like this..<br /><br />///***CLEARNET WARNING***\\\<br /><br />http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/737571832/100_Natural_Caffeine_Powder_Bulk.html<br /><br />///***CLEARNET WARNING***\\\<br /><br />recognize anything??<br /><br />its actually one of the better cuts for heroin. anything you get is going to be cut with something, and if anything this is one of the cuts you&#039;d prefer. caffeine will melt and run just like heroin and won&#039;t affect the taste. its way better than your sugar cuts or some of the other shit i&#039;ve come across like violin rosin or make up foundation powder. those things will really fuck up your gear. caffeine and mannitol are usually only used by professionals who know what they&#039;re doing. so you will usually find when these cuts are used then the percentage will be kept to a minimum and the cut will be mixed in well. although that&#039;s no assurance that dealers further down the line will not have cut in anything else, but with c63s gear i could not detect anything else. <br /><br />there was definitely no sugar cuts, those are easy to detect by dabbing the cool beetle and seeing if its sticky. c63s wasn&#039;t sticky in the slightest. sugar cuts are also often noticeable by tiny little frazzled dots in the residue left on the foil. this is because sugar turns to caramel when heated and small pockets of caramel in the beetle will often stick to the foil as the beetle runs off. they then just burn up and leave those tiny black dots speckled in the residue.<br /><br />so yeah i had 3 lots of his last gear and although it was a little touch on the darkish side the gear tasted great, always run fine for me and was nice and strong. i can&#039;t wait to get my hands on this lighter gear that is said to be even stronger than the last. sounds awesome.

				his B grade stuff has a sugar cut and is noticeably sticky when you dab it with your finger, it will stay stuck and the whole foil will be stuck to the end of your finger. if he&#039;d cut any of that into the A grade stuff then there would be at least a slight stickiness to the beetle. i dabbed every one and there wasn&#039;t even a slight tackiness to it.<br /><br />that said his B grade is still ok to smoke, not the best smoke but its still easily smokable. its ok if you&#039;re on a budget and want your gear to last longer as its half the price pretty much. a gram of that will last longer than 1/2 gram of his A grade but will obviously take longer to get the full hit. but as you said, if you are IVing then the A grade is definitely the one to go for. a lot of us who smoke like the practice of smoking in itself, so it can be nice to have £40 last two days of booting rather than just one.

I also thought I&#039;d got the B quality stuff by mistake, but c63 told me it was the A quality.<br /><br />The good news is that his latest batch is back to the quality in July and before, maybe even stronger if that&#039;s possible. I was tooting two small match-heads of the stuff and getting well high for five hours. It&#039;s the same very fine dust and pale brown in colour. Like before, it&#039;s so fine that it can be hard to deal with as it gets static electricity and sticks to things. Does that sound familiar?<br /><br />I want to order again now, but I&#039;m worried that C63 still has some of the old batch packeted up waiting to go out.

				i think i&#039;ve just got his new one but it isn&#039;t a great deal lighter than the gear he sent me two weeks ago. i&#039;m smoking it right now. its nice gear, has a lovely earthy taste but it also does have just a very slight tackiness to the beetle indicating a slight bit of a sugar cut in there. its really not a lot tho, doesn&#039;t affect the taste and the beetle has a nice dark color to it and runs really nice a clean.

				Well my crack and bag of B grade H arrived today same as is allmemem i was ut in transit monday so I mean u really cant fault that.<br /><br />I think my main negative about c63 is it has left us all spoilt hahah like I think everyone has had one articular order that seemd to just be perfect like quick delivery and gear that even better than his usual then after that I think I tend to forget that Im still illegally buying heroin off the internet so to expect every order to be exactly the same is fucking ridiucal. Like I know im not alone in being dicked about by various dealers IRL when buying anything in terms of less than par quality and maybe even shit weighing in light so to think we can order gear thats better than the uk street stuff and have it turn up to ur door in 3 days is mental especially since i weigh my shit and he never seems to be under for me&nbsp; (admitted this cant be done exact due to stealth)<br /><br />Well im going to try this crack now i&#039;ll let you know how i get on.

				this is an outrage. but then i gotta look on the bright side. its payday for me today and i had to buy £90 worth of btc and put them in sr this morning to make an order. but my order from C63 turned up at about 8:50 and i got right on it. so i never got round to buying the btc and transferring them to sr. if i had i would have lost the lot, no messing. whether i just put them in sr or actually made the order. there&#039;s no way the vendor would have in transited before those fucking pigs did their bullshit. i can&#039;t remember the last time getting on a white one saved 90 quid and my ass like that.<br /><br />btw, does anyone know if C63 is on bmr or sm? i&#039;m guessing he isn&#039;t gonna just give up with an operation like he has going. i just read in another thread that bo3 is going to bmr.<br /><br />anyway guys, its been great getting to know some of you. i&#039;m going to look on bmr forum to see if they have a UK and EU H vendors discussion thread. if they do i&#039;ll catch ya&#039;ll in there. if not i will start one soon, look out for it. i&#039;m sure if we keep our heads together we can work shit out for mutual benefit. two smacked out gouching heads are better than one, as they say lol. take it easy guys. this is a real sad day i know. it was certainly great while it lasted and i&#039;m glad i can say i was part of the silk road community while it lasted.

				<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve been looking on Sheep &amp; BMR, there is not much No3 Gear on either, I did find Beston3 on Sheep, but as there is no escrow that I can see there, I will not be using. I really hope something turns up quite soon, I have a bag of C63&#039;s but it won&#039;t last more than a few days, then onto the subbies for a bit, until I can find an online supply of No3, fuck going back to the street regularly.<br />Has anyone any ideas, the back up forum is not run by SR but a vendor has set it up, and are apparently working on a SR type site, the forum back up is here<br /><br />&nbsp; http://6zyze2mkwyla7jwe.onion/silkroad/backup/index.php<br /><br />They ask people not to post until this forum falls, if it does, &amp; I really hope it does not. <br />Stay Safe &amp; well <br />C <br /><br />PS Seeds&amp;Stuff,&nbsp; I would like to know where you are off to, if any where.

				i can&#039;t help but keep thinking why the fuck is this forum still up. the feds must be hoping to get more arrests and they wouldn&#039;t want any potential suspects to have any opportunity to cohort any stories. the less communication they have between now and them being arrested the better as far as the feds are concerned. the only other option is they are watching it like a 13 yo boy seeing his first pussy to see what info they can get to use.

				Funnily enough I just reestablished street connections last week after four years. Gear OK, bags a bit small, gear dirty but strong, but could get 3 for price of 0.2 here. On subs anyway.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Best 0n3 is on sheep, contacted me here, seems to be him unless I&#039;m gonna go totally tinfoil. he never used PGP so.....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All drugs has popped up there too with same PGP key. So far, I sent him my key encrypted to his key, but he sent me a message I can&#039;t decrypt. To simplify I have sent a word encrypted to his key, hoping he can tell me what it is. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems like him, but it would be easy for someone to copypaste his public key and take orders, then say need FE due to uncertainty of new situation, then it woiuldnt matter if he can&#039;t decrypt addys! Also he was reselling cmg63 gear, so did he have other way of eupping than SR? I will report back if he can reveal the magic word!

				Shit man, not done subbies in years, think i was one of the first batch here in the UK to do &#039;em. Remember keyworker telling me they were this new alternative to meth and were much better. I waited till i started to cluck like they said and took &#039;em..... and felt like utter shit for 2 days!! Even then i just never felt quite right on them and hated not being able to get anything off gear unless i planned ahead and stopped taking them or was on a low dose. All in I&#039;m much happier with my meth! Always found it gives you a little bit of a cushion even when you ain&#039;t doing gear.<br /><br />That would be cool if you spot them. Never used best on3, what was it like? Like you say its bloody expensive for number 3, though if i didn&#039;t have my regular man i&#039;d consider it with some of the crap I&#039;ve seen from idiots in town!<br /><br />I used that top notch once about the start of this year i think and it wasn&#039;t at all bad but seems reading start of this thread things went to sh1t...<br /><br />Cheers for your help and will post here if i find anything on BMR/Sheep. Not gonna jump in till i know its the same guy. I see a few of the US/Canadian guys are on there and while i used one or two of them before and they&#039;re legit, they just take too long to get to this side of the pond for my liking. I&#039;m impatient waiting for my number 4!!!<br /><br />

				I have just spent an hour reaching the minimum of 50 posts requirement in order to have permission to post here so any help will be truly appreciated.<br /><br />I ordered some H from c63amg last week on Thursday 26th September. He asked me to FE and marked it in transit the next day Friday 27th...( this was last Friday exactly 7 days ago from today ).<br />Unfortunately it has not arrived yet and half the order belonged to a good friend of mine. Usually it doesn&#039;t take so long to arrive (I live in central Europe) so my questions are<br /><br />Has anyone who ordered around the same time as myself or after, Did you receive the package?. did you FE? <br /><br />I ask because around the 29th he said he was very busy and im thinking that the site may have been siezed before he had a chance to sent it.<br />I wish c63amg would contact us because he was the best and very professional... I will let you all know if i find out anything more.<br /><br />Also a heads up there is a new user called c63amg_official claiming to be him but when i asked about my order he said he will check. (so far no info on my order just a pm letting me know he is accepting orders again) be careful since its a new account.

				Hi UK<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on the other sites.<br />I have spoken(msg) to FrankM he is on sheep &amp; will have a listing for No3 up soon, he said he was waiting on pictures.<br />C63 is a member there too, his page was created a while back, so I don&#039;t know if its a imposter or not.<br />The link to his profile on sheep is here, there are no listing up.<br /><br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/account/profile/cfeb2b4a85033560c485a0bf63719e0e<br /><br />I will finish my last order off today, so I will be looking a bit harder now.

				On RMR has anyone tried non SR vendors in the past? Been looking at a few German vendors for #4 but having never used the site before and at how slow its running atm cannot really get any info. <br />Germany - UK&nbsp; a good/easy customs route? just trying to stay clear of NL if i have to ship in. Been looking at Canadian also, anyone ever order from tomorrowman? <br /><br />BMR is really bad for any domestic H product really. Trying to refind my weed vendors also.

				Hi <br /><br />Take a look here&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php<br /><br />Quite a few well known respected vendors and forum members are there. C63 has joined there, thats the first I have seen of him since the loss of SR.<br />I hope this is the one. I just don&#039;t like BMR there is no uk no3 &amp; sheep just does not inspire any confidence, so I&#039;m staying away from there, I have joined and maybe if nothing else turns up I will end up getting some gear off there, I hope I don&#039;t have to.<br /><br />C&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Longevity is key and therefore have to cede respect to BMR.&nbsp; Sheep, if you look on redditt seems to be based in Czech rep and many flaws/lots of info revealed about servers.&nbsp; This SR 2.0? Nothing will enrage the feds more than a complete copycat website.&nbsp; SR is finished, make a new name/site.&nbsp; They may bust this incompetent site quickly just to instil fear.&nbsp; Seems far too rushed and in my experiences, when you rush things you make mistakes/ leave yurself open.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope there is a new website, but it will take half a year I think.

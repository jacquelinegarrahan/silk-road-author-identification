				Just wondering how often the price we see on SR items is updated to be consistent with the current bitcoin value, since it is a constantly changing. Thanks.<br /><br />Also, a dumb question i wont waste a new topic on, how do i go about using a local jpg file for my avatar? ;D

				I&#039;ve often wondered the same thing. I was once in a position where I had SO NEARLY the right amount to buy something that I kept refreshing the page and eventually managed to be able to buy it!

				Well that implies that its pretty close to real time, but maybe each vendor is responsible for keeping it that way. Still, is it based on the high/low value?

				I guess it depends strongly on the vendor. For example Baroso has updated his prices 2 times in the last 5 days. For other vendors I haven&#039;t seen a price update for 1 week even regarding to the skyrocketing BTC prices.

				Would have thought the most sensible way to do it (could be wrong) is that the vendor puts how much they want for their product in USD and SR automatically converts it to BTC based on the current exchange rate. But don&#039;t think it updates as regularly as preev, hence the thing with managing to refresh

				I am fairly sure the vendors put in the USD price and the system keeps track with the BTC value.

				That does make sense. I wonder how it works out when there is a difference in the price due to the seller not updating frequently through a surge in BC value. ??? I haven&#039;t made any transactions yet so i don&#039;t know, but i have seen some prices that seemed too good to be true when doing my own calculations using current BC value.

				The BTC value goes up and down a lot. Sometimes you can be very lucky. Or not. The System here probably isnt as fast updating the price as the BTC marketsplaces are.

You mistaken BTC for a FIAT currency, there are no standard conversion values. You could find BTC for $16.50 and also some selling it for $17.50. It is the seller who decides for what price he&#039;s selling and the buyer can decide if that price is accurate for him.<br /><br />Correct me if got something wrong

				The btc rate on SR is the hourly average of Mt gox rate so it updates every hour. Vendors either decide to have the prices set on btc rate of USD currency and the system automatically updates the price on a regular interval.<br />As for your forum avatar smple choose an image resize it to 65x65 and upload and it will process an image that size to give you a personal avatar.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				There we have it. Just as I thought. <br /><br />And now let´s find another topic to generate posts so I can finally get into the forums and discuss about the vendor who is currently scamming big time. The 50 post rule is a joke.

				Haha, I am down for experimenting with some K, haven&#039;t tried that. I&#039;ve done lots of LSD and shrooms, but you know what? I take it back. SALVIA! You get a big hit&nbsp; of the strong stuff and you&#039;re mind and body become strung out over space in time in a very weird way.

				Salvia can be scary because it&#039;s an overwhelming trip, but i always feel some sort of afterglow when coming back to baseline plus the elements from the trip and the thoughts i have during it make some sense, most of the time.<br />So i&#039;d say the most fucked up drug i did was PCP, nothing made sense on the night i tried it, but i obviously had too much.

				You have to consider the situation not just the drug. For me Salvia but I did it at home alone and it scared the shit outta me but I was safe. GHB is not threatening at all but you can do some fucked up shit on it. Passing out in a public shopping centre only to be woken by security kicking you arse out makes you wonder how long you were laying down and how many people walked past pointing at you. LSD and mushrooms can be intense cos it feels like it will never end if you want it to. Never tried DMT. <br />My guess for worst people have done and I dont know if it should be considered a drug or a poison is Datura or its extracts. Ive read some freaking shit scary stories of peoples experience on this stuff and I will never volunteer myself to go near it. <br />For myself Id go with Salvia. It only lasted a few minutes but that shit is intense.

ROA were oral, nasal and smoked.<br />There was a major mindfuck, more than anything i ever experienced, minor visual disturbances, euphoria, feeling of being drunk, but what characterizes the experience is that i had almost forgotten about all of it the next morning, which is the reason why i didn&#039;t take PCP again.<br />There are two things i clearly remember from the trip: my friends and i were playing Pokémon Stadium and during the Drowzee Mini-Game, my friend said: woah, i never noticed Drowzee had a siren&#039;s tail.<br />And the other one was a weird impression while my friend was driving us around (very responsible, i know.) i just didn&#039;t understand the movements the car was doing in space, i was under the impression that we were spinning and that sometimes the car would go sideways and backwards even if we would be on a straight road.<br /><br />it didn&#039;t keep me from experimenting with other dissociatives later (which i love), but i&#039;m not sure if i&#039;d try this again.

				Nitrous, LSD, DMT, Gasoline, Amphetamines<br />in the order of how hard they fucked my mind for the time I was under the influence.<br /><br />Really though, daily drugs I don&#039;t mind; alcohol in small quantities, harmalas, and grass.<br /><br />If you have not gotten into harmalas yet you will probably do many more drugs looking for what they have for you, day-to-day wise. My experience at least. So many people I know will take a bong rip of passionflower over grass or cigarettes if they need to relax now.

				I&#039;ve tried drugs of almost every class, ranging from RC&#039;s to LSD to DMT to opiates &amp; amphetamines, dissociatives, benzo&#039;s, etc. <br />By far most fucked up drug I&#039;ve ever done is Diphenhydramine, aka Benadryl. It&#039;s a deliriant like scopolamine. <br /><br />Taking twenty-four 25mg benadryls turned me into a hallucinating zombie with no control over my body for many hours. Blunts turned into joints, which I then stuck into my face (the cherry) and dropped into a black abyss between my feet. My friend had to get out of the car, open the door on my side, and pick it back up from between my feet because I was incapable. We bought weed from a close friend and I had NO clue who he was. I saw one of my best friends in the park, got excited and ran up to him, then walked away forgetting he was there. At one point I went home to get something and my friend told me to make sure I didn&#039;t forget he was there. So I was naked in the bathroom, about to get in the shower when I though I should check out the window to see if my dad was home and I see my friend&#039;s car with a group of people waiting for me. It had probably been 20 minutes by this time, so I put everything back on and apologized when I got out to the car. They thought I had gotten in trouble or something. Other effects included robot like walking and thinking I was home with my family or in some other situation whenever I closed my eyes. <br /><br />It left me feeling like a part of me was missing and gave me something like restless leg syndrome for a few weeks. I couldn&#039;t stay relaxed in bed and constantly jerked around. To anybody considering trying this, I would highly recommend against it. It&#039;s not fun, it&#039;s not safe, and you won&#039;t remember most of the experience anyways.

				once after drinking 750ml vodka and a case of beer with my cousin I decided to down two bottles of Robitussin and watch Eraserhead. Turns out I ate the pills and passed out 30 minutes later. I woke up at 6:30am to a complete nightmare. The walls in my room felt like they were bending and about to fall on me. I had no Idea why I was so fucked up because I was blackout drunk when I took the pills. I go stumbling into the living room almost totally unable to walk. I can barely see because my vision is so blurry. THANK THE GODS my friend was already awake was able to tell me what I had done to myself because I was assuming I had gone completely insane.&nbsp; <br /><br />DXM worst trip.

				The most hallucinogenic thing I ever did was cough tablets,&nbsp; not sure what the active ingredient was, probably DXM. Did it at a friend&#039;s house watching movies. The cat came to sit on my lap and it had 2 faces. Even by touching the faces I could not work out which was the real one. We also went to &quot;play&quot; outside. It looked like there were asteroids all over the place. As we were running through a field, my friend said - watch out for the river and jumped over it. I also saw it clearly and just managed to get over it. Our sober friend behind us said there was nothing there. Loads of other things, too many to mention. <br /><br />The difference between that and all the acid and schrooms I ever did was that I seriously could not work out what was real and what was just fucking with my mind.

				In the late 90&#039;s there was an xtc pill with no logo called &quot;no name&quot; (surprise) Aparantly it contained heroin, amongst other things. It took me and 4 of my friends to a place we really did not want to go to. That was too much.

				Puretyaboveall: No pills contained heroin ever. At least not any from the streets, cops pressed one to prove you could though once lol. However that would be silly as heroin&#039;s oral dosage for psychotropic effects is very high and would be very costly. It doesn&#039;t make financial sense to put a more expensive drug into a pill. In other words; no one did it and for good reason.<br /><br />Lucy23: Perhaps you were more sober. I&#039;m not a neurologist but perhaps 2 agonist with similar binding affinities competing at the receptor caused you to be more sober when the peak effects of the 5-meo-dmt wore off? Maybe some one with more knowledge than me could elucidate us?

				My very own invention of a new I.V drug similar to a snowball but miles better it consists of 0.15g #3 Heroin +0.10g my secret stimulant making the combined total 0.25g hit that for at least 1 hour delivers an overwhelming feeling of energizing bliss and happiness followed by a smooth Heroin ride through the natural &#039;comedown&#039; you would expect from a buzz as powerfull <br /><br />My very own invention of a Heroin Snowball combined with the right measure of my secret stimulant is like one of the strongest and also most enjoyable highs i have ever experienced.&nbsp; The stimulant I have added is countless times more intense/enjoyable and healthier to I.V than a regular Cocaine/Heroin snowball. You feel awake and instantly more compassionate and aware of the enviroment feeling almost like an MDMA buzz 1 -2 hour/s after your hit. As the snowball coninues to melt The stimulant in the snowball will have left your body completely and this is where the Heroin totally irons yourself back out gradually meaning NO COMEDOWN WHATSOEVER. I have just opened a vending account under the same name and will be listing my Snowball mixture at a special sample price to let you all see the future of Heroin I.V use. Unfortunately I can&#039;t access SR at the moment and am running dangerously low on my #3 Heroin.. If anyone is interested in advance then mail me here and you could be the very first to try/review my HeroinHighBall trust me when a couple of people test this I&#039;m certain this type of combo of drugs will SNOWBALL. 0.50btc will buy you enough for mixture for two decent -snowball- hits. Each hit will come in its own bag for which you to empty onto a spoon add water and heat (no need for Citric acid as my stuff does not need to &#039;Have adulterants broken down&#039;) My listing for my Heroin Highway journeys will open this week though message me on here if you wish to try them sooner

It used to be like green, yellow, blue, red, purple and black maybe. We took the red one and man everyone freaked out so made. I had this vision that I was trapped on a ferris wheel in some evil carnival and it was slowly turning from 3D to 2D. I took the yellow and it was actually pretty fun and pleasant.

				Whoa! totally have seen the ferris wheel on salvia trip! haha without any evilness though, never felt any &quot;evil&quot; on any trip except eminating from another person. But Ether is probably the most fucked up drug i&#039;ve ever used. I binged on it for like 2 weeks straight everyday with my friend. He ended up blacking out eventually while driving and totalled his car and sumhow didnt die(I honestly have no clue how he survived that crash) and after that we stopped, but somewhere in the foggy haze of the middle of the whole experience is when one of the craziest drug &quot;trip&quot; feeling I have ever had occured. We were chilling in a little car huffing the fuck outta that damn Ether rag, I was getting super fucked up, both of geeking out at retarded shit while the &quot;rushing&quot; &quot;buzzing&quot; sounds started to pulse through my whole body. Everything at that point started to get all red and blue like 3D realm looking and then all of a sudden... Wooooom! blackness, I didnt exists, existance didnt exist, nothing was real. This was the first, and only time I have ever experienced complete and totall Ego Death. And this truly was ego death, to the point where I couldnt think at all, like literally thoughts could not happen at that moment because thinking did not exist. The only thing I could compare it to would be like being in a video game but not, because stuff in video games EXISTS in the physical world to some extent, lol as 1&#039;s and 0&#039;s on a CD or whatever. But during this shit I was in a realm of non-existence, which is sketchy as fuck because it feels like infinity also. Im sure theres a few of you out there that know what infinity feels like lol. You can feel &quot;infinity&quot; through the use of many different psychadelics, usually at a good strong dose lols

				Toss up between crack and pcp.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never done anything really wild and crazy on PCP but my friends all say it&#039;s nuts to even try it, so I guess their consensus would be that it&#039;s probably the wildest drug I&#039;ve messed with. I&#039;ve done it more than once and had some wild imagination and everything but wasn&#039;t going crazy in the streets or any of that stuff you see videos of.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done crack a couple of times and honestly, for me it&#039;s not worth it. Very short high and I prefer something longer, plus I like the hallucinogens and stuff more than just straight-up speed.<br /><br />Snorted heroin but never injected it and don&#039;t intend to.

				It has to be crack cocaine. It&#039;s the candy of drugs. I can&#039;t believe something that counter productive to human life even exists. It is so quick, so fleeting, and it&#039;s barely a high. The effects on the user are only evident after long term use but 5 minutes after you smoke, on your way down, you would do anything for more. Anything. I&#039;ve only smoked it a handful of times and I&#039;m happy to say that it is in my past. If that drug were allowed to run wild the lower class of America would be a million times worse than it is today. In terms of motivation to fuel an addiction, it makes Heroin look like benydryl.

				The craziest drug I have ever taken before would have to be 2C-I<br />I had it on Gel-Tabs came in a pack of 50.<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s just say I took 15 of them at once, and I literally could not feel my body only my head on my shoulders.<br />I literally felt like I was dead, it was actually quite scary I was watching Alice in Wonderland (The New One) and there was a part were they are getting chased in the forest by a huge beast like animal (I don&#039;t remember what it is because I was tripping so hard and never seen it since) and that is when it became to much I started questioning who I am, and what am I ever doing I almost felt like I was depressed because I was tripping way to hard and I wanted it to stop. The other times I took 2-3 it all went smooth but I would watch out on how much you take. On all 15, my body was getting really intense feeling like pressure in my muscles felt uncomfortable to walk even. I was seeing rainbows on the outer layers of the TV and it was gradually getting more intense and intense.<br /><br />Synthetics are definitely interesting, I prefer the real deal but for the price on synthetics it is really hard not to go with it.

				For me it was certainly Phenazepam. I got it as white powder and accidentally took a huge overdose. Even worse was that I forgot that I was on Phenazepam during the trip so I constantly kept on taking more.<br /><br />My amnesia lasted nearly five days, some friends told me I had a minor car crash. I have no memory of this at all but a big dent in the front of my car. Seriously I&#039;m glad I survived this.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t done Phenazepam again, it&#039;s so damn difficult to dose right.

				I&#039;ve tried most drugs but meth and K but the worst drug i ever tried was one of those experimental drugs (like 2C-B or whatever), it was like 12hrs of feeling like you had the flu and + just did a whip-it.<br /><br />Also, never was a fan of drinking but its not that bad.

				Amanita muscaria, the red and white spotted toadstool.<br /><br />They were much easier to find near us than any Psilocybe. But nobody had ever tried them. I made a tincture from the red cap skins using vodka, based on some dodgy intel.<br /><br />Made about half a pint from a big bag of them. Took a small shot and spent the next twelve hours vomiting every hour, on the hour. No buzz at all, and it made me really drowsy. I was alone and was fairly worried that I could pass out and choke on my own vomit. The next day, things looked a tiny bit more interesting, no way worth the puking/death flirt though.<br /><br />Have since found out from the &quot;Psychedelic Encyclopedia&quot; that you are supposed to use whole and dry them first, as that deactivates a lot of the bad stuff and boosts the happy stuff. Haven&#039;t been back to test this out though. YMMV.

				why is everybody so negative about salvia :(<br /><br />i remember back when i bought the 60x salvia from the local headshop just to show-up my buddy who was bitching out after saying he was down to buy it. cost me $100 for 1g of 60x!! god i felt stupid but it lasted for a long time...he settled with 20x strawberry flavor<br /><br />anyhow salvia is fun. you just tell yourself okkkk im going to be out of it for the next 2-5 minutes after i take a rip from pipe.<br /><br />i remember the last time i smoked it i literally did that and went and laid down in bed and remember getting the lung tingling sensation then the pull like something is sucking you down to earth and next thing i know im talking to Indiana Jones during his commercial for his last movie when then i started to sober up and realize what i was doing.<br /><br />laughed out loud and said that was great.<br /><br />ive had funner salvia trips that i could talk about but wont. the craziest drug ive ever done would probably DOB!!! I have no proof that it was DOB but it was on blotter and we had no visuals really...just body high.<br /><br />I was like wtf this isnt LSD...why do i have a slightly stronger body high but no visuals...the weed isnt even helping. WASTE OF TIME....anyone ever come across DOB? Apparently like a knock off lsd<br /><br />Note: im not into drugs that much. just started a smoker, always wanted to try acid and finally did a few times, did a little white girl at good parties just for a funner time. nothing much over here

				Don&#039;t like to see salvia getting such a bad rep! Sure, it&#039;s strong...but only weak drugs are shit right? And it is over quickly. It doesn&#039;t play nice with anything else though. DM Turner wrote a funny account of how he tried it straight after DMT and he &quot;saw&quot; the two plant spirits battle it out, each majorly fucked off by the presence of the other. The Salvia won.<br /><br />I always feel like I&#039;m one spoke of a wheel, and there are many of me (spokes) spinning through space(s), and I&#039;m never sure the wheel&#039;s going to stop spinning and leave me back where I started. A big fucking Wheel of Fortune with my life as the prize! <br /><br />It always does though ;)<br /><br />Wonder what else might lie in the Salvinorin family tree...

				2c-e is by far the most fucked up drug i&#039;ve ever taken. for the most part, i&#039;ve tried every drug i could ever want to try, and 2c-e sounded like exciting new territory... <br /><br />well it was a heart-pounding, dark, weird weird anxiety-ridden place... and my husband came home early from work and decided now was the time to tell me &quot;you have to decide between me, or drugs. now.&quot; his face was melting and flickering and i was too fucked up to say much other than &quot;you can&#039;t make me do that.&quot; he was furious and left.<br /><br />i had a few seizures alone in the bedroom and was convinced i was going to die. i thought, this is it, i can feel myself dying. i made peace with death but was more terrified than i had ever been in my life. i can&#039;t imagine being more scared.<br /><br />never touching the shit again, its been 3 years and i still havent used ANY more of the 2c-e from that bag, tho i still have it somewhere.

				Taking too much PCP was a bad experience for me. I sat in my room tripping out hard. I became paranoid that I was so high I could bite off my tongue and not even know it. I obsessed over this until at some point I forgot it was only a hypothetical and became convinced I had bit off my tongue. I looked for it every where and couldn&#039;t find it. Somehow sticking out my tongue and feeling it with my hands didn&#039;t convince me - I mean, I could totally have bit off some of it. how long is my tongue supposed to feel anyway? etc. etc.

				Everything I&#039;ve ever put into my body has been on the &quot;milder&quot; side of things.&nbsp; The ones that wrecked my body the hardest were probably meth (a week with no sleep is pretty bad for you not to mention the effects of the drug itself), spray paint, and xtc (not sure to this day how I got back to my hotel room that weekend, I woke up 2 days later). I should throw 20 years of smoking cigarettes onto that list, they messed my lungs up pretty good, but all that&#039;s in the fairly distant past.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m a health nut nowadays, but I do try to eat clean

PCP is probably one of the worst....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the worst drug necessarily. If you use it carefully with the respect it deserves I don&#039;t see a problem with it. Horror stories about having &quot;laced&quot; pot --- well if it&#039;s PCP that&#039;s gonna be fucking miserable and scary because a strong dose is fucking weird and fucked up as shit. But in small doses it&#039;s just downright pleasant. Like having a nice cup of tea on a lazy sunday. PCP was very auditory for me, so I could just smoke a little, space out a bit and I&#039;d hear the craziest music swarming around my head in a way that&#039;s really difficult to explain. But you smoke too much and it&#039;s not good. unfortunately you can&#039;t really measure out PCP in proper doses like a lot of other drugs. You smoke until you think it&#039;s about right and if it&#039;s not about right... be in for a very weird and unpleasant trip, especially if while you&#039;re still high from it&nbsp; your mom comes home early and asks you to unload the groceries for her and you&#039;re having intense auditory hallucinations and have to figure out everything by sight.<br /><br />PCP is a really dangerous and strange drug. I understand why it has the rep it has. But at the same time, the reputation is far worse than the reality. You will never have the strength of ten men and need to be taken down by a dozen police officers. If you&#039;re so fucked up you think you&#039;re superman, in my experience, you&#039;re too fucked up to walk properly.

				You people crazy<br /><br />And I Am advocate for Salvia! She is lovely, if you know how to partake correctly, just use your common sense, if you have any left...<br /><br />And if people were wondering about similar chems to Salvinorin A, you should check out Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether, extremely interesting<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;www.erowid.org/chemicals/salvinorin_b_ethoxymethyl_ether/ <br /><br />But if one could find a synthesis for this extremely amazing sounding chemical, then hypotheticaly speaking, one could extract salvinorin B from on of the many non psychoactive species of sage, which commonly contain salvinorin B!!!!! I really want to research this, I believe this could be blottered and we could have a new revolutionary movement like LSD created, well at least revolutionary to the drug war, probably be made illegal, but awesome nontheless!!! If I could learn myself I probably would not market it anyways =p<br /><br />P.S. I heard DXM could be taken in veryyy large doses and is not a very dangerous chem at all, safer than tylenol, so how does such great negativity get produced??? Well with cough pills its obvious(especially triple C&#039;s) the acetiminophen fucks up your liver more than alcohol lol, that would probably make you feel like shit, yes?<br /><br />I really think mostly everything can be moderated, for example, one could take very small doses of certain chems that do not produce, or barely produce any mental effects at all, and through good scientific studies there is a good chance you&#039;ll find positive effects somewhere in the many biological systems of the body, whether short-term or long-term. And in this same example also realize that these positive effects would also most likely come with negatives, long and short term alike. Life is full of Yin &amp; Yang, its all around us, and inside us...

				I have thought long and hard about this.....!<br /><br />I have done a lot of drugs over 25 years and been fucked up (in a good way mostly) by so many ;-)<br /><br />Like being asked to pick a fave film or music its hard to pin down.&nbsp; So I have a top 3 &quot;fucked up times&quot; to share if you forgive me.<br /><br />in no particular order<br /><br />1. Passing out in the mud at a festival after way too much dancing on shrooms, just totally spun out and next thing I was on the floor being trodden on.&nbsp; My mates rescued me and apparently I was as white as a sheet and sweating like i had been hosed...and covered in mud!&nbsp; Not a good look<br /><br />2. Taking WAY too much MDMA with a group of mates (mix of boys and girls).&nbsp; we all banged shit loads of lines of really good MDMA, (prob over 300mg each over the night) and all ending up naked in a massive half serious, half hillarious orgy thing...immense fun but we all felt a bit weird next day waking up in a heap on the living room floor covered in random duvets and pretty unsure who had fucked who!! Probably not one for the &quot;safe and responsible sex&quot; guide..all good in the end tho we still get high together but have all been a little more careful&nbsp; since<br /><br />3. When i was 18 having my first LSD trip on a purple microdot (supposed to have been 250mics) and being totally blown away, mad as fuck for 12 hours amazing!&nbsp; ended up lying on the flat roof of a building 6 stories up smoking a joint looking at the stars and feeling totally insignificant in the universe but totally happy with it.&nbsp; Not really fucked up but sooooo powerful<br /><br />So thats the top 3 covering shit, stupid and amazing fucked ups!<br /><br />Oh yeah and ketamine is weird too<br />

				In terms of the most powerful i would have to say DMT without a doubt. Had never hallucinated a fraction like that before or since. Mushrooms run a distant second, but it was more dark room hallucinations rather than straight out tripping balls.<br /><br />Without crazy visuals it would have to be LSD. My mind has never felt so open :) And each time for 8+ hours!

				I invited my friends round to repaint my flat. I was moving out and had to return it to a normal appearance, since I had painted much of it a fetching shade of mauve and had illustrated the walls with eight foot egyptian and occult symbols.<br /><br />I decided to reward my friends&#039; goodwill with ketamine. Another friend had given me a large bag and I handed it out whilst we were attending to the skirting boards. Needless to say I disappeared down the k-hole and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the most terrifying experience with a paintbrush I have ever endured. <br /><br />When I was even younger and yet more foolish I shot up a speedball. I accept that a heart attack has its thrills but I preferred not to make a habit of that.

				Salvia is certainly up at the top. There have been some acid trips on the fractals and the flies from around 2003 that were otherworldly experiences. A 10 strip of strong acid, smoking some very fine bud while coming up, or doing some k while peaking put me on another planet for an hour or so. <br /><br />Worst experience was definitely pure dxm caps. Not sure what the mgs were, full standard size caps. Oh god the itching, and puking, and more itching.

				Salvia made me an unhappy person when I tried it. I suppose that was the worst one, at least to me... and that I know what it was. <br /><br />I had a friend who tried bath salts... after the fact the said that at various points he wanted to take a chainsaw to his head or drink a lot of milk. He wasn&#039;t entirely sure whether or not those feelings were at the same time or individually. He did neither, but he didn&#039;t recommend it. I&#039;ve avoided that craze though... I&#039;m not keen on detergents in my nose... Another friend got in a fight with his wall doing pcp. I refuse to do that too.<br /><br />I did one day pick up some &quot;mdma&quot; stupidly from a dealer at a party that I didn&#039;t know. Was the last time I made that mistake. To this day I don&#039;t know what was in them, but I took two and they knocked me the F out - one of the chicks at the house I was at took a video of me... damn was I talking some nonsense. Something about purple monkey dishwashers.

				I lived the party, don&#039;t give a fuck and get fucked up as much as possible lifestyle for 15 years before I calmed down. A few of the most intense experiences, in no particular order:<br /><br />- a friend and I huffed some sort of contact cement thinner when we were young teenagers. Poured a capful in a small plastic bag and held it over our mouthes. It was like being in a cartoon, crazy closed eye visuals, no sense of time, just tripping balls. Very unpleasant&nbsp; taste and brutal &#039;hangover&#039; for days afterwards. Do not recommend to anyone under any circumstances.<br /><br />- We made mushroom chocolate with about an oz in a large baking sheet sized piece of chocolate. I ate what had to have been about 10 grams of the shrooms, and had a long and exciting adventure. We were out camping, and I was at one with nature, watching the sky and the sunset, then wandering around in the dark with a tiki torch and tripping on the shadows. Such a fun time, but way to high a dose for unexperienced shroomers.<br /><br />- Up for 6 or 7 days on the pipe led to some terrifying hallucinations. Sleep deprivation as much as the drugs I&#039;m sure. Hiding in the closet thinking people were coming to get me. Not fun at all.<br /><br />- First few times I tried X were cool. Once was after a big sporting event, just walking around among thousands of fans and celebrating and high-fiving, very euphoric and a great time. With a girl I was banging for a few months we&#039;d get pills and get wrecked every weekend, some amazing times with her before we both settled down. Eyes rolling back and just wired, man those were fun times.

				2C-B<br /><br />Something must have been off with that particular batch. Really nice body+mind high for 4 hours, spoke with some people, then enjoyed some Ramsey Lewis jams on the couch, but experienced horrible terrors as I tried to sleep. Saw stuff in the shadows in my bedroom, when I close my eyes I saw horrible, contorted, evil faces flying at me. Sat with the lights on from 2 to 4am before I passed out from exhaustion. Woke up with what felt like meningitis, couldn&#039;t even keep a painkiller down so spent the day hungry, dehydrated and in pain.

				Oh and went somewhat bad on shrooms one time, as in experiencing complete identity loss. Wasn&#039;t too bad actually since I was level-headed enough to know that this was because of the drugs so I just figured &quot;Ehn I&#039;ll sleep it off and see what identity is mine when I wake up&quot;.

				So far, the anxiety attacks from some high quality Ice has been my worst experience yet. 4am and I was having a freakout thinking I was about to have a heart attack. My toes and hands were so cold and I was having muscle cramps. I almost woke my parents up, but I ended up calming down with a hot shower and not revealing that I decided to try Ice.<br /><br />Has anyone had very bad anxiety attacks while on Ice?

				Salvia by far - and I&#039;ve done DMT. With DMT, despite all the intense indescribable shit that was happening in my head, I was aware I was under the influence of DMT the whole time and knew it would wear off soon. Salvia was just as crazy and intense but I had no idea wtf was happening, or who/what I even was for that matter. Absolutely terrifying, surprised I didn&#039;t shit my pants. This was 60x extract though, so strong fucking shit basically. 20x was a lot more enjoyable.

				Peyote is probabily the worst I have seen first hand. I had a friend who disappeared for 3 days. Dont know what happened to him during that time but long story short he was a werewolf.<br />&nbsp;<br />PCP was just insane even though I dont remember much of the night and work up the next day still feeling it. Could only see straight with one eye open. Felt like I was floating. Told a really good friend of mine if he wasnt a friend I would have killed him. (probabily most fucked up I have done!)<br /><br />Salvia was a fucked up experience 40x out of a waterfall the first time I tried it.. Got stuck and was told by banana man this was my life now. <br />Then ended up walking into a huge vag. and came out of it in the shower.<br /><br />LSD has just been always fun. The first time I did it I seen gnomes everywhere and I was stomping then out. But the kept coming.&nbsp; <br /><br />XTC wasnt fun one night when we had something in it that made lights droopy.. and just felt like shit all night.<br />I also did some of the xtc bath salts and that was just a really fucked up night I ate the inside of my mouth up.. it was not a good high at all.<br /><br />Meth sucked i just wanted to clean my apt<br /><br />Coke didnt like it when I hit half a G and couldnt move bc i thought my heart would explode but wanted to just take off..<br /><br />Pot.. I actually smoked so much I passed the fuck out and fell straight back lmao. then woke up ready to eat everything in the house.

				Salvia.&nbsp; Knew it would only last ten minutes or so, but it felt like forever.&nbsp; The whole world, and I with it, curled up at the edges and became so hellishly warped.&nbsp; I experienced a deep sense of loathing for everything.<br /><br />An unidentified synthetic cannabinoid, I was told it was just bud, and I was drunk too.&nbsp; I lost control of my legs and puked all night before blacking out and waking up covered in my own vomit, thinking &quot;that was one fucked up dream I had last night, where I thought I overdosed and that I might die-HOLY SHIT, that was real!&quot;

				I am convinced Salvia is the devil&#039;s drug.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only done it once in my life and it probably wasnt the best situation for me..<br /><br />Someone had packed a bowl and handed it to me and told me to clear it. So I hit the fuck outta the bowl.. turned around to ask &quot;hey how much did you get this weed for?&quot; They said &quot;WEED?&quot; then everything got weird. Looking back on it.. it&#039;s like I was looking into what ever infinity would look like. My whole body froze up and I fell to the ground and everything around me was just blending into its self. I started laughing uncontrollably and my beard felt like it was growing vines out of it. I started to freak out because in my mind I really thought I was running through the entire house destroying everything while laughing like a mad maniac, but I was just rolling around on the floor. After I came down.. I had this sense of doom lingering over me.. and it felt like I had just experienced what it was like to be in the devils world.

				MDPV- made me feel kinda good for about 5 minutes, then i got anxiety, nausea and jittering real bad. half an hour later it was over but for some reason i wanted it again. i took half a gram of it over the course of 3 days i don&#039;t even know why, it was so horrible. Finally i flushed the rest down the toilet. I had depression, my legs and fingers sometimes moved uncontrollably and i had weird visuals like clouds and blurry visions. this went on for 2 weeks or so.<br /><br />Horrible drug.

				Ok you guys might think I&#039;m lame. My doc are usually opiates liek vicodin , percocet, or amps. Anyways one day I had nothing good to take so I found some lyrica around the house. Looked it up online and figured give it a shot cause I was desperate. After taking like 300mgs I felt pretty peachy for about an hour and then shit went bad, lol. It was seriously fucked up. The walls started pulsating, the room started spinning. It was like a really bad LSD trip while being drunk. I just went o my bed and curled up in the fetal positon, lol... I text my friend and told her I was going to die! lmao... umm ya funny thing is I wouldn&#039;t mind doing it again.

I worked with a nurse who got arrested because of Ambien. If he wasn&#039;t wearing scrubs, he looked like a total thug. Skull tats, mushroom tats, etc all up and down his arms, stern look with a bald head, and wore outfits that could be best described as biker-techno. Well he took his Ambien and figured it&#039;d be a good idea to drive to McDonalds in his boxers. Drives there, orders food, and ends up driving up onto the curb. Out of his mind, gets arrested and I guess resisted somewhat. He remembers none of this. He came-to handcuffed to a stretcher in the ER with a foley in place. Just another night on Ambien.

				The cartels do make a huge chunk of profit off of mexican weed imported to the US, well moreso back before the huge medicinal boom and shit, but if everyone who smoked could grow their own shit, they would loose a good bit of profit, the only thing over that they got goin is the cocaine. And yes good sarcasm, I would never take a word the U.S. government says as true. And omg phenazepam is fucked, A month is crazy, I bought a gram and did a tiny bit and blacked out for 2 days, I would keep taking it even after blacked out too, and I pissed my girlfriend off a lot, hehe wish I coulda seen myself acting like a little child.

				Most fucked up experience is probably salvia, I think it was 60x?<br /><br />Took a gigantic hit and was transported into an entirely different world, one of cartoon mice and cats. <br /><br />I was a mouse treasure hunter, digging for treasure in some sort of cave. After I found the treasure, tall, whispy purple cats (kind of looking like Ms. Bitters from the Halloween episode of Invader ZIM) started attacking with giant purple fireballs and I freaked out until I stopped tripping. <br /><br />Turns out the &quot;digging for treasure&quot; I was doing was tearing all the sheets off of my friend&#039;s bed.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Closest to that is DMT. Similar type of &quot;otherly world&quot; trip, but much more pleasant.

				Hahahaha, that trip report of salvia made my day pizza, Although I find salvia to feel quite natural compared to DMT, although I dont trip to well on salvia anymore for some reason =( I have smoked a full gram joint almost of supposedly 50X extract with no avail, just felt like the air around me was a styrofoam block I was stuck In. Now if I want to smoke salvia I make sure I am already tripping good on something else, Like on AMT and Moxy and HBWR seeds all at the same time I smoked a nice joint of salvia extract wit my buddy and it turned everything purple with these crazy purple cloud thingies just floating around the air in my room, but It was crazy because I could walk around, talk and even take a piss, when usually a dose like that will send someone to fucking crazy land. I recomend people to smoke salvia while tripping! Only If you are a psychonaut =p&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve done just about everything there is. I love LSD and shrooms have a special place in my heart. I liked some of the 2C series and 2C-T-7 is pretty crazy you gotta be careful with dosage. I personally don&#039;t think cocaine is to special. I recommend mescaline to anyone who likes psychedelics or if you want the full experience DMT but the absolute most insane drug has to be DOI. I&#039;ve done DOB, DOM, and DOC but DOI on a heavy dose is an experience and a half. Lasts a very long time and for me made everything extremely organic and I mean everything. I have done it twice at 1.5mg and 2mg. Don&#039;t think I&#039;d choose to do for fun just not my cup of tea.

				Accidental...<br /><br />Naltrexone... taken too soon thinking it would just loosen up my bowels after an opioid binge. I am thankful I didnt get PTSD from the 20 hours that ensued before I was able to overcome its blockade and forcefully end precipitated withdrawal (think regular WD compressed into 1-2 days and amplified by a factor of 50... suicide is common in case studies for patients who tried to tough it out)<br /><br />And that was my intimate lesson with pharmacology 101 Chapter 3: Long acting antagonists taken after long acting agonists and their effect on the central nervous system:&nbsp; A little slice of hell<br /><br />Intentional...<br /><br />Methylmethaqualone, vaporized.<br /><br />I was lucky, and did not convulse or seize, but it was... surreal. It is an analog to &quot;Quaaludes&quot; and is not popular because it tends to cause tonic-clonic aka &quot;Grand mal&quot; seizures in recreational users -- along with other analogs to Methaqualone [still waiting to try MQ proper]<br /><br /><br />But also my first Methoxetamine experience. I overdid it a little and my alien way of thinking and alien logic process freaked me out a little - I knew it was all perception and a drug experience but still it was a little disjointing. <br /><br />I insufflated 2C-E. Yeah, I know, stupid. But as usual I didnt hallucinate, not that I&#039;d notice between all the &quot;AW FUCKS&quot; because of my burning nasal membranes lol.<br /><br />

				For me it was some sort of synthetic cannabis.&nbsp; I was smoking the stuff for a while, I was not ready for what one blend had in store.&nbsp; My cousin gave it to me after her boyfriend had what looked to be a seizure on the stuff.&nbsp; It was by a company called &quot;Down2Earth&quot; and I think the name was Purple Power Plant or something like that.&nbsp; One rip and I was sucked into myself in the weirdest way, the spirit of the chemical took me over, and I felt like I made contact with alien minds.<br /><br />I still have the pouch sitting in my stash, I&#039;ve only taken a half hit here and there since.&nbsp; I actually haven&#039;t touched any of the synthetic cannabinoids in a long time now, they seem to fuck me all up after a while.&nbsp; To this day I&#039;m not sure what they put in that Purple Power Plant, it puts me in a very strange head space I can&#039;t really put into words.<br /><br />And this comes from someone with about 100 psychedelic experiences, including LSD, DMT, Mescaline, countless Tryptamines and Phenethylamines.&nbsp; I never wish to visit the mindscapes some of the synthetic cannabinoids took me, ever again.<br /><br />Salvia can be pretty damn strange too, it always has the biggest body load for me, even more so than Ketamine, MXE.

				I would say crack cocaine as in my experience that seemed to have way more addiction potential than regular cocaine and is too short lived of a high that just makes you want more and more even if you are not big into uppers for the moment while under the influence it turns you into a damn crackhead.&nbsp; Having said that though, considering the dangerous potential and the brain cells killed, I have to say the most fucked up drug that i have ever done would have to be AC refrigerant(Freon).&nbsp; I only did that twice, but I should never have done something so stupid as I aim to be a responsible psychonaut.&nbsp; I also used to eat lots of Clonzapam(K-pins) and drink lots of alcohol and feel like some brain cells were certainly killed, like between the effects of my depression/anxiety/general mental state and that kind of drug abuse, I feel like my mind is not nearly as sharp as it once was.&nbsp; Please use drugs responsibly; I hate the negative reputation that drugs get in the media and our own stupidity does not help the situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Probably tame compared to some others but I used to grow a lot of hydroponic shrooms in college. I took a mycology class as an elective for my molec biology degree and learned a thing or two, got some spores from PF way back then and went to work. Got so good at it that I could grow shrooms with the bluest stalks and nice fat cap that would fuck you up beyond anything I have experienced before or after, including LSD. Tried to make LSD in the chem lab, it ain&#039;t easy and didn&#039;t work lol.

				I just to keep my brain pretty much intact so I&#039;ve never done anything really dangerous but I&#039;ve had some pretty weird-ass experiences. <br /><br />Number one being salvia for sure. The weird thing about it was how I forgot I was high. No matter how much lsd, 2c-i, 2c-p, 2c-e, molly, or shrooms I do, I never forget I&#039;m high. I always feel pretty in controll. Sometimes my thoughts will get loopy or I&#039;ll waste a lot of time fiddling with something instead of having fun (this happens with acid if I try and use any kind of technology and it starts bugging out. Instead of just leaving a lone I pick at it like a scab), but I&#039;m always pretty in control. With Salvia though, I totally forgot who I was, and I wasn&#039;t even that high. I thought I was a father of a family of light posts, and all my light post children were talking to me. That&#039;s the kind of silly ass shit you see in cartoons and in dumb drug PSAs. Never had that kind of weird experience on LSD. It has that dissassocitive effect. <br /><br />The other weird experience I had was when I was coming down from an acid trip and huffed a bunch of Nitrous. It like exploded the fractal visuals in my eyes and I thought my brain was fragging out it&#039;s visual cortex software system. I was staring at the cement, and there was this white spot, like some old paint or something, but I didn&#039;t think it was just a white spot, I thought it was the visual rendering software in my head getting a glitch, like a shader in a video game going hay-wire. I thought I was seeing through the universe. <br /><br />And then I realized it was just a white spot hahahaha

				I nearly forgot because it was so many years ago, but in college we took a trip to the El Paso/Las Cruces area and went out in the desert type area and did some peyote. Crazy shit to say the least. Still love the shrooms best though. Peyote is not something I would want to do often, or maybe even ever again.

				Back in the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s I did a lot of LSD. Really good LSD at that. Well one night we got the bright idea to IV some LSD. Crushed up a little purple micro dot into a kind of slurry and ran it up. Well I went first and I guess from my reaction no one else dared to try. Hours later when I could again comprehend what I had done I realized what an asinine thing it was to do. Although I still trip occasionally I will stick to eating my doses.&nbsp;

				Well I have had very few bad drug experiences considering how much stuff I&#039;ve done. But even though trying easily over 30 different substances I only have 1 night I regret. Started off with me and 2 friends doing if I remember correctly 200mg of 6-apb. Ow I should mention this would be my first time trying anything other then smoking pot. Anyways we had a great time. Later on we scored some E. Went back to my place and me still being completely fucked up dropped 2 and a half pills. One of my friends then pulls out a bag of really cut amphetamine. We did a few lines and about an 2 hours later I wanted to die. I spent the next 32 hours laying in my bed trying to fall asleep somehow. Dident work :P Ow and later on I did some research and found out that the pills were complete bunk. Nothing but mcPP in them.. You can imagine the comedown I had haha.

				I took a huge hit of oxy laced weed and didn&#039;t react well at all, I hated it.

				Once upon a time, a CTO friend of mine with more money than God handed me a meth pipe full of meth vapor.<br /><br />I did a REALLY heroic dose, without realizing just how much I was taking. It&#039;s hard to judge molar mass from a churning cloud of vapor in a glass vessel.<br /><br />Later than night, I was moaning like a little slut, while everyone was giggling at how ridiculous I was being.<br /><br />Since I am ADHD, it takes a lot of meth to make me feel high as fuck, as opposed to weirdly &quot;normal.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s probably the only reason I&#039;m not dead.

				I haven&#039;t really done any fucked up drugs. My main DOC is marijuana and psychedelics (mainly DMT, mushrooms, and the occasional LSD). Although I have done Adderall and Vyvanse (sp?) but the most fucked up I&#039;ve done (probably not fucked up by standards here) is cocaine. It was fun but it wasn&#039;t THAT great.

				order some yourself and try it out.&nbsp; there are ALL KINDS of adderall suppliers on the road.&nbsp; it&#039;s not too much to pay to give it a try.&nbsp; most are around $10-20 for 20-30 mg and that&#039;s a fine dose to try it out.&nbsp; you&#039;re going to want more, but I feel like the prices are too high on the road.&nbsp; I pay like $5 a pill on the street.<br /><br />it&#039;s a very different drug than cocaine.&nbsp; the effects are a little slower on come-up and longer lasting.&nbsp; it&#039;s also less euphoric.&nbsp; it makes me want to get down to work.&nbsp;

				Back in the day, about eight years ago, I used to take these over the counter drugs called Coricidin Cough &amp; Cold. We called them triple C&#039;s. I think there were about sixteen to a pack and I would always take like three packs daily. My girl could maintain, drive around and everything. Me, I was fucked up beyond belief and I would always pull something crazy. It was like ecstasy almost but more intense and sort of violent really. I guess it depends on the mindset you&#039;re in when you take them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done a lot of drugs and almost all different kinds, but those OTC triple C&#039;s were something else entirely.

				Odd.<br /><br />It seems more of a disinhibitor than anything else.<br /><br />I suppose cough medicine could potentially block epinephrine and cortisone, and induce much more empathic and erotic, or potentially aggressive, behavior, but that&#039;s just a guess.

				Most fucked-up experience: 30 mg 2C-T-7. Had only 1 dose, well experienced with a bunch of other 2C&#039;s, but apparently I couldn&#039;t take this one. Fucked me up with fullblown, personality-shattering delirium, combined with a high level of mistrust for my co-trippers. I didn&#039;t have a nice time, they didn&#039;t have a nice time.

				Personally, every salvia experience was a really good laugh for me. I&#039;m usually sweating so much during it, my shirt becomes disgustingly wet. But I always feel good for 10 minutes and trip my head off, then it&#039;s gone anyway. We always took a big puff of 10x strength though, nothing like these crazy 40x stuff.<br /><br />But one of my friends had an egodeath-like experience, she was genuinely in silent terror, and turning white. I noticed earlier, that getting up while on salvia and walking around shortens the duration, which was annoying for me during a good trip. So we grabbed her gently and made her stand up and walk around the room, so she returned to reality and was really happy to see us &quot;again&quot;. Then she felt like going mad for about an hour, before it completely wore off. It was like a bad trip on shrooms, but fortunately shorter.

				Another nasty experience I had was when I was stupid enough to try butorphanol IM. Opioid used for animal analgesia, but not pleasant at all.... Sort of panic-inducing in a strange way, and felt quite as a powerful respiratory depressant. It is NOT fun to try to make a sterile injection formulation of naloxone crystals in the right dosage when you are semi-nodding on a substance that just increases anxiety.

				LSD; while back in the 80s we had all sorts available, purple or green microdot, blotters with all sorts of designs, etc. But the CRAZIEST shit I ever tried was a plain white blotter my g/f at the time shared with me; it was her parents&#039; (who were university professors and into &#039;experimenting&#039;). <br />Over the course of 35 years or so, I&#039;ve tried pretty well all of the drugs except the more recently invented designer drugs like the 25b&#039;s and 25c&#039;s and the previously unavailable plants like salvia.<br />If you define &#039;most fucked up drug&#039; as one that fucks with your head the most, then for me it&#039;s that LSD blotter. As some have noted in relation to salvia, potent acid will absolutely melt your ego into fucking liquid. Everything you thought you knew about life, afterlife, anything at all, really, will change after you get fucked up on this drug.<br />I understand that the trip with recent hallucinogens, like salvia, are crazy but very short, like half-an-hour. With strong LSD be prepared to be in another consciousness for 8 hours or more. <br />Definitely a life-altering drug but one, needless to say, shouldn&#039;t be taken without carefully planning out the setting.<br />I love reading all of the peeps&#039; experiences here; fun thread...even my ole pal rustykoin&#039;s ;)

				Oh, one more--PCP.<br /><br />I thought it was just a joint. Sure, it had a funny taste, but I had not been stone in a while, so I didn&#039;t question the taste.<br /><br />When it hit me I had to lay down. I couldn&#039;t lift my head off the floor.<br /><br />I don&#039;t hang around with those &quot;friends&quot; anymore.<br /><br />It reminded me of the Dave Chappelle skit called &quot;A night out with Wayne Brady.&quot;<br /><br />JeanRob

				For me it&#039;s definitely got to be some of those legal highs. My friends and I used to smoke them a lot when we were younger.<br />We got this partcular little baggie once and it had flecks of blue card-like stuff in it. One of my friend&#039;s girlfriend had a full psychotic break and just sat bawling in the corner for 3 hours. Those legal highs can really mess you around if you don&#039;t have a proper hold on yourself...<br /><br />All the ones I&#039;ve tried have been way more intense than anything illegal I&#039;ve done, in terms of herbage at least.<br /><br />Beware, the legal highs...<br /><br />Annex

				number 1 = salvia<br />number 2 = illusion synthetic thc<br /><br />On salvia the first time bunch of friends took it, i only had a little bit.<br />&nbsp;then straight after we get a call that friends were in a car crash and one is in a coma, so we have to go to the hospital. not good.<br /><br />second time was alright for me, friends gf and I have some first, laughing so hard at anything, no visuals tho,<br />&nbsp;then friend takes a massive hit and starts to walk around like a zombie. then he tries to jump out a 3rd story window while we are laughing at him trying to stop him, then he has a seizure on the ground and we are still laughing at him (we couldn&#039;t stop) trying to help him.<br /><br />last time with the same friends as last time, we took turns. <br />i sat on a chair and took a bigger hit than last time. as soon as i blow it out shit gets fucked up. like an endless loop lasting what felt like days,<br />&nbsp;i would be sitting on the chair then it would fall over sideways with me on it and i would be on the ground for a second then instantly back straight up on the chair. this repeats for ever and it was horrible at the time i would have rather died than that keep happening.<br />&nbsp;so after what was probably a minute or two the visuals change and i am transported to a new dimension.<br />&nbsp;i am in a room with plain walls no windows. the roof disappears. then the floor disappears and looks like en endless abyss that if i fall down i will surely die.<br />&nbsp;then out of the walls some hands appear. then arms up to the shoulder. all over the room. the only way to not die from falling is to grab onto some arms, so i do that and they feel fucked up!<br />&nbsp;they look normal with skin but to touch feels like holding onto a skinless arm i could feel all the muscles and blood and tendons. very disturbing and this lasts what feels like a life time.<br />&nbsp;so finally i come out of it which was about 5 minutes real time and i don&#039;t recognize a single person in the room, someone says i took salvia and then I go curl up in a ball in the corner on a bed for 30 minutes until i remember where i am and who the people were.<br />Life changing experience. will not ever try it again.<br /><br />synthetic thc wasn&#039;t as bad but i almost died for real (i think)<br />had done it a few times because of drug testing at work. just little bits. same effect as weed but shit compared. <br />last time i took it i had a huge amount to see what would happen, spend next hour with a half smoked cig in my hand. sitting on a chair, hearing my heart stop a couple time, realize i wasn&#039;t breathing. having to concentrate on breathing the entire time. almost losing consciousness because lack of oxygen.<br />After an hour i manage to crawl inside and to a couch where i lay down for hours<br /><br />next thing im gonna try is some dmt :D <br /><br />other drugs used: lsd, speed, opium, weed, alcohol, 25i, shrooms, some more cant remember

				dmt is nice<br />mdpv comedown is nasty (especially highdose)<br />snorted H once<br />drug whose one-time use fucked me up the most: dichloropane<br />drug that fucked me up the most (and is the best of all drugs ever): weed :D<br />most impressive drug experiences:<br />1. 5g shrooms when i was 16 yrs old... was my first real drug experience only weed and alc before, while celebrating Black Christmas, christmas for Metal fans... kind of funny story they where all about 25 and told me that this was a normal beginners dose... I loved it).<br />2. Smoking DMT for the first time (while being high on 2c-B and MDMA) (much older)<br />3. LSD is always great had it on an animal-adventure-farm last week (too many kids... pretty stressful but still great)<br />4. 4-HO-MET gives strong and beautiful visuals<br />5. Salvia Concentrates are intense<br /><br />drugs i like the least opioids/opiates(always gives me a realy guilty feeling on coming down(like I&#039;m wasting my life), only smoking opium is sometimes worth the rush especially on coming down s.th. else but still to much fear of getting a severe addiction and too much and too long numbness after the 20 min rush)<br />benzos (i don&#039;t take drugs to miss my life 0o but awesome after too much stims and X)<br /><br />Of course both downers feel great and sometimes I can enjoy them but like every 5-20 mins my guilty feeling returns and i forget it again... and so on and so on...<br /><br />But still lovin weed. smoking daily for years.

				I did a native american preparation of Jimson Weed once years ago. Wasn&#039;t scary, per se-- but definitely weirdest shit ever.

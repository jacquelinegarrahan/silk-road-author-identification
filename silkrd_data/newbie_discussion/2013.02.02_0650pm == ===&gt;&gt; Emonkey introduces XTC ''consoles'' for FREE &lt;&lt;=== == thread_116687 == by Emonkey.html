				<br />In the past I announced my new product on the &quot;product offer&quot; section like I did in this topic: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=57626.0<br /><br />Recently users with less than 50 posts can only start a thread in the newbie section and I&#039;m far from 50 post so this is the only place for me to introduce my new product...<br /><br />

				Finally got the page to load and submitted my order. Don&#039;t know if this helped but to anyone else having trouble loading the stealth page I first browsed a category and unchecked the domestic check box and then clicked on a random item and then manually went to the stealth URL and it finally worked.<br /><br />I received a message from emonkey pretty shorty after placing my order and he addressed some concerns I mentioned in the order sheet. I to have never ordered from overseas as I was always concerned about customs and didn&#039;t want to burn my drop address like another user above mentioned but emonkey addressed some of my concerns making me feel more at ease.<br /><br />So far seems like a great seller, awesome customer support considering he&#039;s not only offering the product for free but he&#039;s also offering to ship it for free. If this works out I&#039;ll definitely be a returning customer and often.<br /><br />Thanks again emonkey your awesome!<br /><br />-LokeToke

				Don&#039;t hesitate to order from Emonkey he is one of the most professional vendors I have ever used. Package always comes extra stealthy and with in the time limit specified on his vendor page. He is on my list of top rated vendors and will be featured in the title of that thread soon.

				I missed the special offer, but not too worried as I have some of EMonkeys &#039;Space Monkey&#039; pills.&nbsp; We sampled them at the weekend - here&#039;s the review:<br /><br />Firstly as some people have said above, Emonkeys service and stealth is FIRST CLASS.&nbsp; This is my third order from him/her.&nbsp; 3 days to the UK after it went in-transit.&nbsp; Emonkeys stealth is the kind where the envelope could be opened and given a cursory inspection without raising any suspicion. <br /><br />We had a few mates around on Saturday night, and a boozy dinner led to getting the Space Monkeys out.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t really planning on having them for couple of weeks when we&#039;re going out to a club.&nbsp; Anyway, these things happen when you&#039;ve been drinking...&nbsp; &nbsp;We showed some restraint and all did a half.&nbsp; Being strong pills (on top of booze) this was more than enough for starters.&nbsp; We felt them kicking in after 30 mins, and were all feeling pretty sweet.&nbsp; All dropped another half an hour or two later.&nbsp; Very nice, and the buzz lasted a decent amount of time.&nbsp; Very pure MDMA pills, and they are undoubtedly 180 mg (as advertised).&nbsp; &nbsp;Still got 6 of the Monkeys saved for clubbing, and looking forward to doing them properly and having a good dance.<br /><br />If anyone is looking for a reliable pill vendor, look no further.&nbsp; A+++++++++++++++<br /><br />Thanks EMonkey.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />PTF

				it&#039;s funny your other two threads are on the front page of the product offers page and you made them when you had one post.

				Emonkey recently sent me one of the Nintendo&#039;s as a free sample (and also included 6 small brown pills with a mushroom print on them!??&nbsp; What the fuck are these?? I&#039;m intrigued).&nbsp; These arrived today, so didn&#039;t get a chance to sample at the weekend when we went clubbing.&nbsp; However, I already had some of his Space Monkeys stashed. Me, my wife and friend all dropped a whole space monkey and chased it down with one and a half of his green &#039;playing card&#039; 2-CB tablets....<br /><br />The come up was tremendous. Lovely clean pills. Within 20-30 mins we were really feeling it and all got straight down to the dance floor. Plenty of energy and got right into the music. After an hour we could also feel the 2-CBs playing their part. The visuals were very nice, and I particularly enjoyed looking up at the massive mirrored ball above the dance floor!&nbsp; A really good combination.&nbsp; We topped up with another cheeky half Monkey and this kept us dancing till 3am when the venue kicked out.&nbsp; The night bus home was entertaining, as was getting back and having a smoke and enjoying the residual hallucinations from the space monkey / 2-CB combo.&nbsp; Top night!&nbsp; &nbsp;Didn&#039;t feel too bad on Monday morning which was also a bonus.<br /><br />Emonkey is a top vendor.&nbsp; He&#039;ll look after you. Top communication, perfect stealth and excellent pills. Easily my favourite vendor on the Road now.&nbsp; I only wish the SR and Emonkey were around 10 years ago when I use to go out clubbing / do pills most weekends!&nbsp; &nbsp;At 38 yrs old I&#039;m keeping these sorts of nights to special occasions..... ;o)<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />PartTimeFiend :)

				Well I went ahead and finalized for my good friend Emonkey even tho it had 2 days left. It has never taken this long from him. I FE&#039;d because SR support were not answering my resolution request but instead they sent me PM&#039;s telling me it was about to auto finalize and this was after I gave it a 20 day extension so I figured I would just fe and keep my stats since SR was going to let it auto fuck me anyway the same way they did with GetYourFix. That was such a clear case and they would not talk to me about it so I figured they had sided with him so I FE&#039;d for his as well. I just lost 100 bucks but I wont complain about it because the road has brought me so much more value then that.

				Had message from Emonkey today. <br /><br />I had (politely) asked him to cancel my order because it was taking too long and the lack of communication was very rritating.&nbsp; <br /><br />He explained what the problem was/is, and gave me a refund no questions asked.<br /><br /><br />Main reason I canceled was because I needed the product by a certain date. When it became clear that this was not gonna be possible, due to the delays, I had to cancel.<br />Now gonna order domestic for a faster delivery.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Note to all concerned: <br /><br />I&#039;m not bashing this vendor. Not at all. Very polite person. <br />But due to his (personal) problems, the delivery date would&#039;ve been far too late.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure people have dealt with and taken delivery from Emonkey, but on THIS OCCASION I&#039;ve had to got elsewhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I placed a small order with him a few days ago that is supposed to ship today. To be honest though, I am becoming concerned with his recent feedback and forum talk of what seems like more non-arrivals than arrivals. Customs seizures and other issues leading to a package non-arrival are far less common than some selective scamming NL vendors would like people to believe. If it is packaged well and proper stealth is utilized, most everything should make it through, especially small items. Emonkey seems quick to give refunds and take his 25 percent while having no definitive proof something was actually sent. I will be sure to update my feedback and the forums with my experience and any suspicions I may have of this transaction when it plays out in time.&nbsp;

				ya idk emonkey said it probably got seized but im seeing alot of people not recieving and with no seizure letter im thinking thats doubtful. why dont these vendors from the netherlands have an option to ship express or something. i got some shit thats harder to pass customs than a few pills and it was shipped express and passed customs no problem. why the fuck would they want it to take longer? everyone should have an option to ship express if the customer is willing to pay for it.

				Express packages typically receive more scrutiny in both domestic and international mailings inside, and into the US. An international express package, while also likely very expensive, would also likely receive extra unwanted attention going through customs is my guess. And an express mailing from the NL to the US, you might as well scrawl &quot;search me&quot; on the side of it.

				havent recieved mine on east coast US either but i mean its a free sample, why not just fe? worst case scenerio you dont recieve and your buyer rating stays the same. like emonkeys paying for shipping and everything, its not like anyone but emonkey would be losing money. even if he didnt send them(which, granted, would be kinda shitty of him), the best hes gonna get from that situation is maybe a couple good ratings for offering free samples and probly a lot of people losing trust in him for not recieving anything. i dont know, he seemed very friendly and responded to my messeges about the free sample faster than any other vender has responded to any of my messeges. those are my thoughts anyway, i could be completely wrong.

				this is a bit off topic but i feel like theres got to be some postal service worker thats just been doing it so long that he can just spot some of these packages on site. like some guy thats been doing nothing but sorting mail for like 20 years that just gets high for free every day off other peoples packages. idk i know that probebly sounds stupid, most of my ideas do lol, side effect of too many binges i guess.

				I don&#039;t know guys.. I think people should remain skeptical about emonkey, at least people who are in the US. It seems as if *none* of us have received anything. I would like to see at least one person from the states who had a successful order with emonkey. We couldn&#039;t have all had our packages seized in transit, especially over something so small. He managed to send out free samples PLUS extras for some people in Europe, but us Americans have nothing! It all seems a bit fishy to me.. (or maybe it&#039;s the whole FE thing he has going that&#039;s making me feel so skeptical..)

				It&#039;s been well over 20 days since my 6x order of Nintendos was marked &#039;in transit&#039; and I&#039;ve waited 5 days in resolution with no reply from Emonkey there, or PMs. I requested 100% refund since i&#039;m almost positive it won&#039;t be showing up. Vendor was communicative at first, and non-responsive after I sent him a message 1 day before finalization. I&#039;ve been more than patient and I won&#039;t be ordering from this vendor again. Don&#039;t recommend.

				So I received my order from Emonkey after ten days from being marked in transit to the us. I ordered one Nintendo, one Partyflock, and a gram of the crystal. The stealth was quite impressive and clever, although only one layer of vac seal was used. It looked like normal, innocent mail on the outside. The pills were padded to protect against breakage and intact, they look and smell like they should. The crystal looks beautiful and like the transparent/white in the listing, and arrived with some nice large rocks and lots of tiny chunks/shards. The crystal taste good as well. Have yet to sample but will update when I do. I must add that I definitely had my doubts about Emonkey, but he did come through on this first order. Much of his recent feedback stated non-arrivals, and also him being quick to refund, which is suspicious to me when never offering tracking. However everything worked out for me in the end, and I should give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and say that my experience with him was overall positive with good communication, great stealth (could add more vac layers or use MBBs), and what look like great products. The molly really is the nicest looking crystal I have ever seen. Thanks Emonkey.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				emonkey has been generous enough to offer me a reship for my sample, I didn&#039;t even message him, I think he just noticed my updated feedback concerning never receiving the sample. The man seems to strive to have 100% feedback, and he doesn&#039;t take low ratings very nicely, which is a plus in my book. I hope this sample will actually arrive, I do have faith one pill can make it through customs. I will update in a couple weeks whether or not I have received the shipment.

Don&#039;t let the politeness win you over. Most the reviews on his page do seem fishy. Everyone is FE&#039;ing and no one is updating on how the product is besides a few people. I think emonkey may be a selective scammer..as it seems people in Europe are receiving shipments, but not US. people complain about no shows, and he offers reships in exchange for 5/5 feedback from the buyer, which gives him at least another month to&nbsp; forget about us. He told me he reshipped mine (1 month after the product was a no show), but I&#039;m certain that I won&#039;t get the &#039;reship&#039;. The no show for my sample has made me know for sure that I most definitely will NEVER buy from emonkey. One major point of free samples is to show that you are capable of doing good business..which emonkey clearly isn&#039;t capable of.

Don&#039;t let the politeness win you over. Most the reviews on his page do seem fishy. Everyone is FE&#039;ing and no one is updating on how the product is besides a few people. I think emonkey may be a selective scammer..as it seems people in Europe are receiving shipments, but not US. people complain about no shows, and he offers reships in exchange for 5/5 feedback from the buyer, which gives him at least another month to&nbsp; forget about us. He told me he reshipped mine (1 month after the product was a no show), but I&#039;m certain that I won&#039;t get the &#039;reship&#039;. The no show for my sample has made me know for sure that I most definitely will NEVER buy from emonkey. One major point of free samples is to show that you are capable of doing good business..which emonkey clearly isn&#039;t capable of.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As I agree with you my friend, but to be honest all of this worries me a little especially including that in a personal PM emonkey stated that they stored buyers addresses and stats which I don&#039;t believe a safe method as a whole and should definitely be avoided at all cost. <br /><br />But I digress once again, as I&#039;m not trying to complain about this nonsense because I am not really an impatient person. But really, what I am trying to get at is this dishonesty is not good, and shouldn&#039;t just be over-looked at all, as Emonkey has shown me not any honesty whatsoever. <br />

				If nothing is shipping to the U.S successfully, then why continue to say you can ship there? Whether you are or not, it makes you look like a scammer. That, or your packaging is unstealthy. One or two orders going wrong is understandable. All of them?<br />That&#039;s a tad suspicious mate.<br />I have received fine from emonkey to my U.K address, but had to be refunded for a U.S order after 30 days of no arrival. This is the first and *only* time I&#039;ve ever not received anything in my year+ on the road, so needless to say I won&#039;t be buying from him again.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t do it, don&#039;t continue to act as though you can. I think you should restrict your post to &quot;worldwide except U.S.A&quot;.<br /><br /><br />edit: also, to add - I was sent a message by emonkey after receiving 75% refund, asking me not to mention the lack of arrival in my rating. I gave him 5/5 and didn&#039;t mention it on the off chance he was genuine, but having read this thread I don&#039;t believe he is.<br /><br />

				Having worked in the post office I can say items do go missing!<br /><br />There is a special investigation unit that tries to catch postmen robbing. They are sent as temp workers sometimes plus with the hi tech devices they have its easy to catch robbing postal workers.<br /><br />I would not blame a vendor if something went missing.<br /><br />One friend has over 100 buys and no losses, another got like over 50% refund after a few grams of coke went missing.<br /><br />I guess its partly down to luck.<br /><br />

				I sent emonkey a message regarding the inquiries around him being a selective scammer. This is what I said <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think NL&#039;s customs is also a good excuse to scam US buyers out of product by saying customs took the product. A few forum members and I have noticed a good amount of no shows for your American buyers, and none of us received any &#039;love letters&#039; from customs..which we think is quite suspicious considering that&#039;s what you get in return for a seized drug order addressed to you. Your stealth doesn&#039;t seem to be a problem here either (which it would have to be if there were products seized by customs), according to some of your reviews, &quot;they arrived in expected time (4 working days) and it have enough stealth to ship anywhere.&quot;, and, &quot;ships speedily and packages securely.&quot; Sounds like your stealth is perfectly fine, so I don&#039;t know why you would have too much trouble shipping a letter over seas to the US. <br /><br />&nbsp;ordered a sample from you to find out what your service was like, and now I feel like you&#039;re selectively scamming US buyers? You have made it blatantly obvious that you haven&#039;t been shipping to the US (considering no love letters), you at least gotta send some shipments to people so you can look partially legit to us Americans! The fact of the matter is, if you can&#039;t ship to the US, don&#039;t continue to act as though you can. I think you should restrict your listings to &quot;worldwide except U.S.A&quot;.

I checked my stats and in your case I reshipped a free nintendo the 18th please show some appreciation have a little patience and please keep me updated.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I mean, he sounds straight up, but everyone here from the US still has seemed to receive nothing.. I still say if you plan on ordering from the NL, order from someone else, as this man clearly does not have his priorities straight.<br /><br />By the way, I wasn&#039;t being a dick to emonkey, and I showed him respect and gave him benefit of the doubt in all my previous 5 messages I sent to him.. I&#039;ve been waiting over a month in a half total for one sample, just to see if the guy was a good vendor, and he still told me to be patient and have faith.. If I don&#039;t receive anything within the month I will be giving emonkey a 1/5 rating, and I suggest anyone else in my position to do the same.

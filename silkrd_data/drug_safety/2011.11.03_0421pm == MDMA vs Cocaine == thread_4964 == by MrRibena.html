				ive done awesome mdma and some mediocre coke so dont take everything I say as super reliable, with coke I find it can make you aggressive and extremely moreish also way too much of a physical addiction can take place, with MDMA however I find it to still be a tad moreish but not so bad and with no physical addiction ( as such) alot more friendly too, with mdma you can freebase or snort it, if your snorting make sure you crush the crystal up nice and powdery or your going to end up with a bleeding nose, I wouldnt gum it to be honest as the taste is fucking awful.<br />definately one to try especially with friends, you can have some crazy convos on that shit and makes you the most social and loving person lol, you couldnt have a fight on that shit thats for sure

				I like both but prefer coke overall.<br />&nbsp;Mdma made me too lovey dovey and expose my inner emotional soul to the postman, amongst others ;D&nbsp; Good in the right circumastances like at a club with a good vibe.&nbsp; My brother in law is a scientist and he measures perfect doses after dissolving the crystal Mdma in water.

				You would take the MDMA orally generally, I have heard of people sniffing it and tried ot a couple times but orally is better IMO. I prefer MDMA over coke. I like the feeling alot better and the come down is alot easier for me. So try and let us know what you think.

				I&#039;ve done both.<br /><br />Coke = snort<br />MDMA = parachute (never snorted it though)<br /><br />MDMA gives you a nice high and makes you feel good for many hours, without that urge to repeat.<br /><br />Coke, on the other side, gives you that extreme feeling of well being.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a price to pay.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only it is very expensive, but the effects do not last too long and you must repeat, repeat until those 5 grams become a few miserable lines.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those are moments of despair.&nbsp; &nbsp;When it ends, you&#039;re down to the ground, no matter how much you&#039;ve had.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had an affair with coke for many years, mostly during weekends.&nbsp; I&#039;d stay awake until early in the morning, watching the sun rise and listen to the birds chirp.&nbsp; It was very good.&nbsp; &nbsp;But she left me.&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not regret it.&nbsp; I wish I could see her once in a while, but her price is prohibitive, not to mention the dire consequences of such reunion.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say MDMA and coke are different drugs.

				Another brazilian?<br /><br />Yeah, but, in any case, you can find farina all year, without the dry season at every end of year we have with marijuana. And the &quot;bocas&quot; are opened 24 hours a day, seven days a week to coke, not the same for marijuana.<br /><br />Even with UPP&#039;s, cocaine here is easier to find and cheaper than Europe, because we send it to them. MDMA goes the opposite route.

And I don&#039;t know if you can find synthetics at boca. I believe you can&#039;t, but if you can, there is a lot of better places to find it.<br /><br />But at least you lived in Brazil some time, right?

				Cocaine really doesn&#039;t do anything for me. I mean, it&#039;s a nice high, for maybe half an hour. But honestly, I would rather do just about any other substance. Feeling a little good and speedy at the expense of a pounding heart and burning nose isn&#039;t that fun. I dunno, maybe it&#039;s just been shitty coke I&#039;ve done?<br /><br />On the flip side, MDMA is practically a party in pill form. Hell fucking yes.

				MDMA all the way. Cocaine is short lived and expensive, while it overall makes you feel extremely well for a short time, MDMA cannot be topped. On MDMA I feel like I can do anything and talk to anyone. On blow I feel well but am usually jittery and I fiend for more once it wears off. MDMA lasts for hours and if you get the pure stuff on this site the come downs are not bad at all.&nbsp; Price is a huge thing as well. I find my self drinking A LOT while doing blow, it would be easy for you and 2 buddies to do 100$ worth of blow and have a huge bar tab. While on MDMA 150mg(like 10$) with another 100mg booster(7$) will get me through the whole night. The only thing I ever get at the bar while rolling is water.

				Depends on what sort of experience you want. <br /><br />I find coke to be good if you&#039;re going to bars and are having a good night out with friends where you can all talk and just keep on going cos you&#039;ve had a few lines, and it&#039;s not too obvious you&#039;re under the influence of a drug. It goes great with alcohol in that you can keep on drinking and not feel too drunk from doing so. I tend to have recovered from coke by about late sunday night/lunch time monday.<br /><br />MDMA is better if you&#039;re going to a rave or a having a house party with people you trust. It allows you to open up and feel the music and dance for hours if you choose, or you can have some close conversations with randoms and well known people. You&#039;ll feel a lot of love and empathy on MDMA which can work for you or against you according to your social circle. Also, it&#039;s pretty obvious if someone is on MDMA although some hide it well. MDMA tends to have me feeling a little down until mid week. Nothing too depressing but definitely lack motivation until wednesday<br /><br />In short:<br />coke for longevity in drinking and talking shit in a bar environment<br />MDMA for dancing all night and having deep honest discussions/thoughts and feeling a bit more spiritual.

				I can see why people like good quality coke, but I prefer MDMA.<br /><br />For starters, coke is mega cardio-toxic.&nbsp; Number one cause of young heart attacks. You tend to also drink a shit load when you on it too.<br /><br />Yes, MDMA is a once a month max. thing if you want to enjoy it. But being able to use more coke (given it&#039;s toxicity and addictive qualities) isn&#039;t exactly a win win.<br /><br />MDMA can expose you a little more - not a problem if you don&#039;t take drugs to act cool and bulletproof.<br /><br />I am outgoing enough...&nbsp; The last thing I need is delusions of grandeur....&nbsp; ;)&nbsp;

Dissolve 120mg in a little water (dissolve completely) and drink that (shudder). An empty stomach helps. Wait 27 mintutes and enjoy ;). Smoke weed, it&#039;s not the same without weed for me. Drink enough water, especial if you dance. Listen to music (the music you listen to on your first time will stick with you). You can boost once (80mg), taking another is a waste. Rolling next day is a waste, ideally wait 3 weeks before taking mdma again, serotonin depletion.<br />

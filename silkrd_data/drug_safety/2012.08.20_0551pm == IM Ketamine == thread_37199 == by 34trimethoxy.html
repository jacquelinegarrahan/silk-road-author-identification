				&nbsp;:)<br /><br />I have a lot of experience with IV drugs, and a lot of experience with Ketamine. However, I have never IM&#039;d a drug in my life, and I have a few questions. Me and my girlfriend are looking to IM the kitty to get the full affects of the hole, as from what I&#039;ve read this is the tried and true method, 100mg shot right into the arm!<br /><br />I have a few questions tho:<br /><br />Do you cook the Ket, or can it be cold shot?<br /><br />Can you use a regular insuline syringe for IM?<br /><br />Also, any advice you have on it would be appreciated.<br /><br />Is it really that different from snorting? <br /><br />Thanks guys. Stay safe.

				I think it&#039;s reccomended to shoot into the leg. Well every tutorial iv seen says in the leg.<br /><br />If you want to hole then the dose is between 60-125.<br /><br />The difference from snorting is basically you hole quicker.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know much about the needle sizes etc. there&#039;s a stickies thread in drug safety I think about IM as a whole.

				First, I&#039;ll explain how to IM liquid K from an injection vial. Then I&#039;ll describe how to prepare your own injection solution from crystal.<br /><br />1. Use a (sealed&amp;sterile) vial for injection. <br /><br />2. put a (any) sterile needle on the syringe, pierce the septum and draw the desired amount of liquid K<br /><br />3. pull the needle out of the vial, then discard the needle. (this is the by-the-book procedure, you can skip this if you are short on needles)<br /><br />4. put a fresh needle on your syringe for the injection, <br />- a 22-25 gauge needle is typically used (the higher the value the finer the needle). For K you can also use a finer one. insulin syringes are 28-31 gauge and work fine, take however extra care to inject slowly (if you don&#039;t it hurts). <br />- The needle should be at least 1&#039;&#039; long. If you inject in the deltoid and you don&#039;t have a lot of body fat, a shorter needle can work. Don&#039;t go below 5/8&#039;&#039; <br /><br />5. Choose either the deltoid or the thigh as the injection location:<br />- The deltoid is the triangle-shaped muscle directly underneath your shoulder. I&#039;d recommend it especially for 1-2ml injections<br />- Thigh injections are described here: http://armymedical.tpub.com/MD0552/MD05520035.htm . If you need to inject more than 2ml use the thigh (but don&#039;t go above 5ml)<br /><br />6. clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, uncap the fresh needle and stick it in your muscle. insert it quickly like a dart in an 90°angle. <br /><br />7. draw carefully to see if there&#039;s blood (i.e. you accidentally hit a blood vessel), if yes: abort the injection.<br /><br />8. inject slowly.... the slower the better (hurts less)<br /><br />9. pull the needle out and press a cotton swab on the skin<br /><br />10. Listen to &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; by Pink Floyd until after around 2 minutes a wave of delicious numbness washes over you.<br /><br />If you have crystal K the process is the same, you only have to prepare your injection solution yourself. You won&#039;t be able to work 100% sterile, so if you have access to vials use them. <br />1. Use in order of preference<br />- bacteriostatic water<br />- water for injection<br />- tap water<br />2. dissolve the desired amount of K crystal in the water. 100mg will dissolve in 1ml of water<br />3. while K will dissolve in cold water (slowly) it dissolves faster in hot water. <br />4. use a micron filter. If you don&#039;t have a proper filter, boiling the solution will work (more or less) to kill bacteria. K will not be destroyed by boiling.<br />If there are water insoluble impurities in the K don&#039;t inject it. <br /><br />This is the complete process - while you can cut some corners, be aware that stuff you inject into your muscle stays there for a long time (unlike a vein). Dirt or bacteria can create aseptic or septic injection site abscesses. No reason to be scared but it&#039;s always a good idea to minimize risks.<br /><br />To answer your other questions:<br />- IM-Ketamine is similar but also very different to snorted.&nbsp; Snorted it&#039;s a nice buzz, IM it&#039;s a trip. Best of all: you don&#039;t have vile drip running down your throat<br />- S-Ketamine needs a lower dose than racemic K, reports about different effects are controversial. Start with 50mg. Be aware however that many things sold as S-Keta are just racemic K (which is much more common). You cannot tell S from racemic by crystal shape, smell, taste, color or the words of your dealer.

I have done lots of IM injections, but only recently with K. Just to reiterate what you actually suggest 2nd. I would say 22-25 gauge needles are way too big. 23g looks like a harpoon, I moved to 25g and it&#039;s still a bit uncomfortable for a wimp! They are probably best when injecting thicker oil based things like steroids, as I do.<br /><br />I have tried K with 0.5&quot; 30 gauge needles, slips into the deltoid really smoothly. It&#039;s a bit short though, so I need to carefully slip it ALL the way in.<br /><br />Pinch your skin to see how much fat is at the injection site. You have 2 layers of skin there, so image the needle needs to be around half that length, plus a bit longer to actually be inside muscle.<br /><br />As for the experience, it&#039;s pretty similar for me either way. IM is much &quot;cleaner&quot;, after a few lines of K, it is a bit gross. I think you can use slightly less than you do nasally, for the same effect, you soon find out though.

				So gave this whole IM things a shot... pun intended. Since I didn&#039;t have a scale, I eyeballed my doses. And only haveing a .3cc rig, I couldn&#039;t dissolve much into solution at once. If I tried to heat it to fit supersaturate it, it would almost instantly recrystalize and precipitate out while it was in the rig, and clog it.<br /><br />So I wanna say I got a shot off of 60mg after already railing near the same amount.<br /><br />I will say this - it feels MUCH cleaner with the IM route. I wish I could try it more, but I&#039;m out of K and out of sterile needles. I also used a s31g needle that was about 1 inch and found this worked great. The smaller, the less painful. I think 28g will work next time.<br /><br />I think I got close to a whole, definitely way out there with some crazy hallucinations and closed eye visuals. I got the K-waves everyone speaks of. It just felt so much cleaner and nicer. 10x better the snorting. Can&#039;t wait to hole.<br /><br />Do you guys normally heat the solution?<br /><br />Thanks for the tips.

				I am going to try this next week. As for heating, K is soluble in water at room temperature, so heating is not necessary. The only reason people heat up H is to increase the rate that it dissolves in water and for sterilization (which is not a 100% method anyway). I have not found a drug that *requires* heating before injecting, is there even one?

				I agree with that, it is just I can go to Walgreens here and pick up packages of insulin syringes in any size without any prescription, but they don&#039;t have micron filters of course and I don&#039;t really want to order them online. I have IVed many things and I always used cotton and never had a problem (knock on wood). But since this is IM, I wonder how bad a small adulterant gets into the needle would really be compared to IV (that is not cotton fever, cotton fever is when you get a bacterial infection from unclean cotton). My local needle exchange also does not give out micron filters, but little balls of sterile cotton and I never had a problem. I know it would be best to get micron filters but does anyone really know if it is 100% necessary?

				IM K is nice sure...<br /><br />Here&#039;s a GOOD idea I did yesterday, take 0.5g K dissolved in sterile water, preload 3 x 1ml syringes. Make a note of the concentration, mine was 183.3mg / ml. Those will keep a while I thought.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a BAD idea I did yesterday. Run late so instead of a lil bump before bed, pin the whole 0.5g like a chain smoker from 1am to 4am. Maybe my recent 1200ug 25c-NBOM few days previous wast to blame, or it was just purely the 550mg in one night, but I was tripping in the morning, strange bright OEV and paranoia. 2 hours sleep didn&#039;t help. Unless it was just touching the NBOMBs while looking for a valium. Shrugs.<br /><br />On the plus side, I pinned another 0.5g K the next day (split in around 3-4 doses), lying in the sun in the garden (headphones). This is a whole different ball game outside, the sun&#039;s warmth is such a boost. The pinnacle was the last blast of around 110mg, sun beaming on me, so warm, so pure, and if you let a tiny bit of light in (squint at the sun), it felt like god&#039;s rays. Beautiful is an understatement.<br /><br />You may want to skip the good idea, it&#039;s too good. Lesson was learned.<br /><br />Needless to say, after an experience so brutally good, I think I&#039;ll take a short break from head fuck. I think I did &quot;ok&quot;, but if someone &quot;normal&quot; saw me do all that, they would lock me up and flush my stash.<br /><br />What seems easy to plan when sober, can go totally out of the window when on the brink of nirvana.

				Hey gals! I&#039;m looking for the easy short answer from the vets on this. I never use IV/IM and I have a 500mg/10ml solution of K and I have the small diabetic needle (3/10 cc, 29 Gauge x 1/2&quot; length) and I&#039;m looking to start at about 20-30mg IM. <br /><br />I believe this is somewhat a small needle... reads 5-30 units... can anyone advise on if I can make up 30mg&#039;s in one or two of them to get my desired average first IM experience? I&#039;ve insufflated a fat crunchy rail of idk how much before and setting was way off, so I am hoping to start again with IM and do it right. <br /><br />Can this be achieved with the size needle I have? <br /><br />EDIT: okay I&#039;m reading the sticky and it seems the 1/2&quot; is the tougher one to get into the muscle. I read on erowid one vet used to shots into the muscle under shoulder in between top of the armpit. Anyone familiar?

It takes a couple, maybe 5, minutes to start kicking in, do the whole dose within those few minutes.<br /><br />However the longer answer is:<br /><br />* Google &quot;spot injections&quot; for IM locations and photos.<br />* 0.5&quot; needle isn&#039;t huge. It&#039;s what I use, and I get it into quads and deltoids without much trouble. Pinch your skin in various places over muscles, and find where the skin/fat is &quot;thinnest&quot; on you personally. You can&#039;t really go wrong, if it doesn&#039;t reach the muscle, or goes into a vein, it is not a HUGE deal.<br />* For 0.5&quot;, shove the needle so far in, the plastic actually presses down on your skin. If you&#039;re using a fresh needle, it is certainly not going to snap off, they bend 90 degrees no problem, the don&#039;t snap.<br />* 3/10cc syringes will hold 0.3ml, or just under, considering some gets stuck in there. Do at least 2 immediately. Just under 30mg is very low, if you have snorted a line of K before. IM is not massively more potent.<br /><br />Loading your syringes...<br />When you load up a syringe for IM, leave a bubble at the top. Injecting small amounts of air is safe anyway, but basically, if you don&#039;t leave around 10 units (0.1ml) of air at the top (not the needle end), then you leave 10 units of K in the syringe (between the plunger and the needle there is dead space). This is why IV users flush it (pull in blood, and then push it back in again). It&#039;s recommend by nurses to have a bubble, the tiny bit of air actually stops the injection leaking back out of the muscle. If you leave a 0.1ml bubble, all of that is not going inside you, it is just left in the bit of space between the plunger and the end of the needle. To do this with my 1ml syringes, I normally pull in 0.9ml or less, take it out of the K, and pull in 0.1ml of air, then flip the syringe to get the bubble at the top, then push the plunger down to get the liquid into the needle so there&#039;s no air at the needle end.<br /><br />Keep safe, use fresh equipment:-)<br /><br />Oh hang on. Is your concentration really 500mg/10ml, or is it a 10ml vial at 500mg/1ml? The latter sounds more plausible if it&#039;s for medical anesthetic use but I know nothing of vials. If you make a mistake here and do 300mg instead of 30mg, then fuck me rigid you are going into outer space. :-) Please get a calculator out and do the sums carefully.

				^ yes to everything he said.<br /><br />It was my first IM too, I&#039;m very experienced with other needle routs so it&#039;s beyond me as to why I was more afraid of IM. <br /><br />Essentially if you have clean gear you just need to ball up and do it. Like a dart, stick it in PULL BACK TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO BLOOD and push in slowly.<br /><br />Just think your a doctor or something, and make sure you hit muscle. Not that hard.<br /><br />Best of luck!

Losing my connection to reality during the trip wasn&#039;t scary at all it was just a strange feeling/experience.<br /><br />Also just want to let you guys know that this will be my last lsd log that I ever do.<br /><br />Logging my lsd experience is interesting and has been fun but I am finding that I am over analysing myself when writing to my log and I believe it&#039;s starting to have a negative impact on my overall trip experience&#039;s.<br /><br />P.S Just wanted to say that my Third LSD Trip Log is chaotic at best I just spent an hour or so spell checking and correcting it.<br /><br />Also just wanted to say as with anything lsd I have no regrets. On my next trip I plan on taking 600ug - If something awesome happens on that trip I might make a small log about it but noting as detailed as my previous logs.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">My Third Trip Report 24/2/2012 (It&#039;s Night time this should be trippy :)<br /><br />22:02 took 2x 150ug blotter on tongue - God help me :)..............P.S I am going to be ok :)...<br /><br />22:07 No turning back :) This is going to be so fucking cool :) Got some Louis Armstrong playing in the background :)<br /><br />22:31 just relaxing Louis Armstrong is just GOLD :)<br /><br />22:50 Just starting to feel it now pupils have dilated like fuck lol :)<br /><br />22:51 was talking to parents.....yes they are here.....They have no idea I am on LSD lmao.....Just told them I was going to bed and didn&#039;t want to be bothered.<br /><br />P.S Using headphones for all my music at the moment This is a late night LSD Trip :)<br /><br />23:02 OMG images are pulsing!

I don&#039;t think he likes me......will keep an eye on him.....<br /><br />2:30 WOW everything is morphing into everything P.S My poster on my wall is cool now were friends<br /><br />2:46 omg Bonnie Tyler - I Need a Hero is the only thing keeping me connected to reality........<br /><br />2:53 and now Louis Armstrong lsd is hell of a substance......<br /><br />2:59 everything is so distorted and I see double/triple vision?

I hope this stuff helps people because logging it all is pissing me off.<br /><br />03:23 just to update I am still alive lol... P.S next time I trip it&#039;s going to be 600ug+ 450ug just wont cut it.<br /><br />3:30 OMG! I just had dram of single malt scotch and the taste is so exquisite!Hmmm I may have another drink<br /><br />3:34 OMG it tastes so good!hmmmm you know after my fourth drink....I been thinking it may not be wise to mix scotch with lsd.........Yeah I should go back to water now<br /><br />3:50 don&#039;t know how but now I am watching WALL·E in 1080p<br /><br />4:07 Just wanted to update I have ever been so emotionally impacted by a movie before. Just watching WALL·E crying with tears of joy.<br /><br />4:25 OMG just so many tears or joy! just finished watching WALL·E so many tears of joy. It was so EPIC!<br />4:28 Just wanted to update I have never been so emotional on lsd emotions it&#039;s strange..maybe I&#039;m just tired<br /><br />4:34 Right people I think my sanity has come back to me. it&#039;s been 6+ hours of 450ug lsd . I am still seeing tracers and mild visuals but nothing major like the poster on the wall shit that was going early on. Still so many tracers...Yeah tracers is the only word I can put to it. <br /><br />4:40 Right almost 7 hours on I just took 60mg diazepam in the hopes that it will help me sleep (at some point).<br /><br />4:43 going to listen to jazz then see about sleeping P.S<br /><br />4:48<br />Just wanted to say that out of all the times that I have done lsd (third trip now) I have no regrets.<br /><br />Every time I trip on lsd I learn something new. I am a better person because of it. I grow stronger.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />5:26 just wanted to update I see a nice afterglow when looking at anything. I love the glow.<br /><br />5:44 I just activated a NATO certified Glow stick and it looks SO FUCKING COOL!<br /><br />6:02 Glow stick looks cool But why did I activate it? I mean it looks cool but NATO light sticks they cost a fortune.....<br /><br />6:11 just wanted to update I love the after effects of lsd aka the coming down effect. It gives me so much time to think about my trip and other things in my life.<br /><br />6:27 I have no regrets I am 100% I am content with who I am I love life and will never turn by back on it.<br /><br />6:32 lsd Is the best thing that has ever happened to me. P.S I think with all that I have said I should try to get some sleep.<br /><br />6:52 Just to update I have 0 energy just going to go to bed.<br /></code>

				i feel lsd is more effective if taken all at once. sure another tab might prolong the trip, but me and a friend a few years back were just eating tab after tab as the hours would pass hoping for something more intense, but it mostly prolonged it. we had a sheet at our disposal a couple times. good times :) also you should go outside next time lol all this tripping just in your bedroom just seems not fun lol

				Hey SpeedCrunch, thanks for posting this. I really like your trip logs - they are entertaining and I can always relate to them because the things you say remind me of how I felt on previous trips, hehe. I actually would like to see the one for your 600ug trip, but I understand that logging everything could get annoying and take the fun out of it.<br /><br />I actually log my trips too, but not publicly. I just have a little sketchbook (aka &quot;trip diary&quot;) and all kinds of different coloured pens, pencils, and highlighters on my desk. I write stuff to myself at different intervals during the trip so that I know what&#039;s going on... just incase I get confused or something and forget who I am, I suppose, and so I can look back and read over the comments to remember the trip the next day. Even without drugs, I tend to be a very compulsive person who writes everything down and makes a lot of lists, etc. so it&#039;s just like a normal activity for me that makes me feel more grounded. When you&#039;re getting really good visuals, it&#039;s fun to watch the words you write dance and hover around on the page. It&#039;s fun to draw random lines and shapes too.<br /><br />Last time I was tripping, I also tried to make a sculpture out of plasticine, but got extremely frustrated that it wasn&#039;t turning out correctly, so I threw all of the plasticine in the trash!<br /><br />I trip alone in my room, too, but luckily I am able to move around a bit and go outside for a couple of hours. I have insomnia, so the people I live with are used to me being up at odd hours of the morning. They also know that I drink a lot of alcohol, so I can always use that as an excuse. Nonetheless, I still get paranoid about how loud my music is and whether I&#039;m going to &quot;blow my cover.&quot; It can get a bit cramped at times. I wish I had the house to myself more often!! <br /><br />It&#039;s always good to have a glow stick. I haven&#039;t heard of the NATO certified ones you mentioned... hm, might have to look that up. Sometimes you just need a trippy little toy or object to play with to give your mind something to do to break up the tension, especially during the latter hours of the trip, I find.<br /><br />Just be careful when you take higher doses. Make sure it&#039;s really acid and not some nasty research chemical that you could end up OD&#039;ing on. Perhaps test any new batches out with 1-2 hits first just to make sure you know what you&#039;re taking. Overall it sounds like you are handling LSD trips well though. Be safe and enjoy! :)

				Ok, you do need to be careful doing large amounts of LSD with your parents in the house, because it is really easy to start wandering out of your room, around the house, and act very very strangely indeed, lol. You didn&#039;t mention them being in the picture before. Anything that is potentially stressful can become exceptionally stressful. And you might respond in a totally freaked out way. I recommend having all responsibilities fulfilled. Nice clean house. Nice clean body. Clean compfy clothes. Plenty of drink prepared. Entertainments prepared. Smooth sailing.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how much L you have left, but I&#039;d recommend saving it for a while and getting some E to mix it up.

My last 2 trips I was alone with no parents around but this time it was late and they where about to go to bed and I had nothing else to do and no work the next day so I thought fuck it why not.<br /><br />But with that said before I do my 600ug trip I am going to wait a few weeks till I am alone and my lsd tolerance level has gone down.<br /><br />Oh and you mentioned E you referring to MDMA(ecstasy)? I have never tried it before. any advice?

It&#039;s great all on its own too, but together with LSD it is an exceptional experience almost beyond words. That&#039;s true regardless of your trip arrangements. But I&#039;ve found certain experiences particularly outstanding. Especially, sex, music, and jacuzzies. If you thought the LSD experience was cool, prepare to be launched into a whole new orbit of awesomeness. And get plenty of good silicon based lube (and be prepared to clean up one hell of a mess, lol) or you&#039;ll likely fuck yourself raw.<br /><br />EDIT: And do NOT try this with your parents home, lol. You will be busted.

				Hi, I&#039;ve been planning on buying coke from here off the brick as (I thought) the prices were better than what they were locally.<br /><br />Found out today I can get stuff off the brick MUCH cheaper than what I expected, and over half the price of what I&#039;ve been quoted here, but before I get some and start selling it I want to know the percentage.<br /><br />I know most off the brick is around 87-90% but recently with the amount of fighting and crackdowns in South America some bricks have been coming in at 70-75% so I&#039;d like to be able to be able to list the percentage of the product.<br /><br />Any ideas ? The only ways I know is that alcohol test where the impurities split off but that doesn&#039;t give a percentage.

				Every dealer says their cocaine is &quot;Straight off the brick&quot;.<br /><br />Which is usually bullshit. Rerock coke =/= off the brick<br /><br />I would weigh out a gram or two and do an acetone wash. If you lose a lot, your coke sucks... If you don&#039;t lose a lot, you have good shit.

				The guy I&#039;m getting it off buys by the kilo, he gets bricks. He sells some of it straight off but most his sales come after he&#039;s mixed it.<br /><br />But it IS direct off the brick what I&#039;m getting and what he&#039;ll be selling me, but I want to not offer it &quot;off the brick&quot; as a selling point..as much as I know that&#039;s the truth (I&#039;ve known the guy for 14 years now and I know his rep as the guy everyone else get&#039;s it off) I want to be able to list a number for consumer self=security. Also I&#039;ve spoke to him and he personally doesn&#039;t test the percentage anyway - for 1 he buys it so often (rather than buying&nbsp; bulk in a month he&#039;ll buy 2-10kg/week) that it&#039;d be a pain in the arse testing so often and for 2 it&#039;d be an insult to his suppliers to test it anyway, especially after so much constant business.<br /><br />But I dunno why I&#039;m defending a stranger to you guys all I want to know is how to do it so I know how to advertise it and how to price it :)<br /><br />EDIT: O and I dunno where you come from buy nobody round here would dare say their stuff is straight off the brick - the state of coke atm, if you get 30% you&#039;re getting premium grade but even the newbies know this isn&#039;t pure stuff.<br /><br />If someone say&#039;s it&#039;s flake round here it will be, and you&#039;ll pay the price for it. But nobody here would charge flake prices without it being flake,as anybody that buys flake know&#039;s what to look for.<br /><br />You get the odd guy saying yeah its straight from the brick as in only had that 1 bash but the guys who are saying this are the ones who are usually talking shit. You don&#039;t need to talk up good blow, people are gonna buy it regardless, and if it&#039;s that good people will always come back to you.<br /><br />Then again I&#039;ve seen stuff where I am that&#039;s not even 5% and the guys have the balls to charge £45/g

				lol why are we discussing the validity of the source ?<br /><br />I&#039;ll put this to bed right now, yes it&#039;s off the boat I&#039;ve seen the bricks, stamp and all, and more importantly I&#039;ve had it before he&#039;s mixed it; not only does it blow your head off but its got that almost paste-like texture to it.<br /><br />All I&#039;m after is a bloomin&#039; way to get a number that I can advertise with, so please, someone must have a definite answer

				to test it you have to snort it, or send it to a dutch lab maybe.&nbsp; and most coke comes thru mexico where it is cut and rebricked with stamps and shipped across.&nbsp; really if its fire coke its probably around 60%.&nbsp; dea posts alot of information in microgram and other places about coke seized, and most of the multikilo shipments were in that 60ish range.

Cocaine is *HIGHLY* soluble...so should vaporize in the water rather quickly<br />2. Taste Test (only thing if it&#039;s altered, gotta be careful)---but put a little on your Tongue---Cocaine is &quot;Legally used&quot; (in the U.S.) as an anesthetic . Taste should be &quot;bitter&quot; (but not horribly so)---and should take a few minutes for your tongue to turn numb. If it has any &quot;BITE&quot; to it---probably altered. It should have a relaxing effect. <br /><br />Also, if you plan on free basing (smoking it)---placing on Tin Foil--there should not be a nasty residue left behind (like black tar). Cocaine will leave a slight stain, but if it&#039;s been altered it will leave a noticeable black stain. <br /><br /><br />

				Here&#039;s the detail from the Merck.<br /><br />Molecular Formula: C17H21NO4.HCl<br />Molecular Weight: 339.82. <br />Percent Composition: C 60.09%, H 6.53%, N 4.12%, O 18.83%, Cl 10.43%<br /><br />Properties: Crystals, granules, or powder; saline, slightly bitter taste; numbs tongue and lips. mp ~195°. [a]D -72° (c = 2 in aq soln pH 4.5). One gram dissolves in 0.4 ml water; 3.2 ml cold, 2 ml hot alcohol; 12.5 ml chloroform. Also sol in glycerol, acetone. Insol in ether or oils. Avoid heat in preparing solution as it decomposes. Preserve in well-closed, light-resistant containers.<br /><br />Melting point: mp ~195°<br /><br />If you have access to decent measuring equipment you can do a few checks to get an idea of how close it is to 100% purity, but without a dutch lab test or access to some fancy equipment you cannot know an exact %, just have a good idea, if its for marketing purposes I would recommend that you get a digital hot plate and heat it up, watch how close it gets to 195º before melting (most impurities will melt at lower boiling points) and if anything is left beyond the 195 mark.&nbsp; The number you get could be used as part of a phrase (&quot;pure coke melts at 195, this shit melts at 190, it&#039;s within a couple of percent of the pure shit&quot; sounds better than &quot;It could be 75-82% purity depending on what bullshit has been added to it&quot;)<br /><br />Combine the melt point test with a solubility test.&nbsp; If it all dissolves in exactly 3.2ml of ice cold water or 0.4ml of room temp water (am I reading the Merck correctly?) then it&#039;s pretty good or your impurities are just as soluble (not likely, coke is hydrophillic, it loves the water)&nbsp; <br /><br />Combining multiple rudimentary tests should give you a better idea of what you&#039;ve got.<br /><br />However your desire to know about the purity of your &quot;off the brick&quot; shit indicates that you are aware that a lot of cutting and re-cutting occurs on the route from the producing regions to your nose.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in the UK (pound sign?) then don&#039;t believe for a second that off the brick means it is not re-cut.&nbsp; Anyone with a brick of coke can grind it down, mix with some awful shit and a binder and repress that crap into two bricks, make twice as much money and not give a damn. <br /><br />My dad had a great dealer in London, got some very nice stuff, came as a brick.&nbsp; I once got to go to the guy&#039;s house and see his old fight movies and do coke that he was chiseling off a video tape sized brick, I was only a kid and very impressed.&nbsp; But I know now that if we&#039;d been doing pure (89% S.American Strength)&nbsp; well I wouldn&#039;t be typing this now or anything except dead.&nbsp; I now live in S.

Reckon I&#039;ll dual test.<br /><br />And yeah you&#039;re right about it being cut after it gets here, but i&#039;m fairly sure he&#039;s high up enough to be getting it &quot;off the boat&quot;. He&#039;s one of the guys who does the mixing in high volume, so I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s this way..but just like you said there&#039;s so many steps between the import and the street that I&#039;d rather have a definitive answer :)

				The Cocaine User&#039;s Handbook is incredibly out of date and terribly disinformative<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One of the more egregious examples of gross error in the drug <br />book realm, was the &quot;Cocaine Consumer&#039;s Handbook&quot; by one David <br />Lee (Berkeley, California:&nbsp; And/Or Press, 1976).&nbsp; In it, Mr. <br />Lee flogged the notorious &quot;Clorox [bleach] Test&quot; for cocaine.&nbsp; <br />This test, described in excruciating detail, and complete with <br />color photographs, purported to detect not only eight different <br />adulterants and diluents, but the relative percentage purity of <br />the cocaine itself.<br /><br />Alas, several years later, the test was finally unmasked as utter <br />nonsense by PharmChem, a reputable Menlo Park, CA&nbsp; street drug <br />analysis organization.&nbsp; Their testing established that the orange <br />color produced when lidocaine is present in the sample being tested<br />was the extent of the Clorox Test&#039;s scope and usefulness.<br /><br />Undeterred, Mr. Lee -- shameless scallywag and possible shill for <br />the Clorox Company -- came out in 1981 with a brand new book, &quot;The <br />Cocaine Handbook:&nbsp; An Essential [sic] Reference.&quot; Alluding coyly to <br />the PharmChem &quot;controversy&quot;, Lee continued to include the Clorox <br />Test (now illustrated with black &amp; white photos), but added an <br />equally useless &quot;foil burn&quot; test (with color pics), along with the <br />detailed procedure for home manufacture of freebase (&quot;crack&quot;) cocaine.<br /><br />Cocaine use had by now begun to lose its cachet, as well as more than <br />the occasional user, so the ever-helpful Lee covered his bases and <br />assuaged his seemingly bullet-proof conscience by including a thirteen<br />page (!) list of addiction service agencies.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

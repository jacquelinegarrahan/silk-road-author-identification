				Ok, so I ordered ten &quot;MDMA&quot; pills from a new yet reputable SR MDMA vendor, but these pills definitely didn&#039;t contain any MDMA. Upon examining the pills I noted they were a little chalky in both consistency and taste. They didn&#039;t smell like MDMA, and I&#039;m 100% positive as I had some crystals on hand at the time. The chemical tasted bitter; similar to MDMA but definitely not in that family. I decided to try one of the two smaller pills out, as I was pretty sure the vendor wouldn&#039;t send me something seriously harmful. <br /><br />Out of the ten pills, six were yellow and flat with an &#039;M&#039; similar to the McDonald&#039;s logo printed on one side and a straight groove down the other side. They measured 8mm in diameter and 5mm in height. There was one blue pill with the mitsubishi logo printed on one side, and a straight groove down the other, and it had exactly the same measurements as the yellow pills. There was an orange/pink pill which was slightly smaller than the yellow ones and it had one rounded side. There were also two smaller &#039;M&#039; printed pills; one green and one purple. These were the ones I decided to try out, as they were the smallest. <br /><br />15 minutes after taking one pill I began to feel it kicking in. This confirmed to me that these pills didn&#039;t contain MDMA, as I always take at least an hour to start a buzz off that. By 45 minutes I was pretty stimulated and I decided it was time to go out. My body was flushing hot and my skin was tingling, but not in the same magical way as with MDMA. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I felt pretty damn good; I was euphoric and running my hands and face under cool water was amazing. I later realised that I was pretty much peaking. My vision and physical functions were completely fine so I decided to go for a drive. Driving felt really great for a bit, but by 1hr 30 minutes after taking the pill I was definitely not as high as I previously was. <br /><br />At the 2 and a half hour mark I decided to take the other small pill, but in two halves with a 30 minute interval between them as I was still unsure of exactly what the substance was. The re-dose provided a little more stimulation, but hardly any euphoria. I guess it&#039;s kind of a one-shot dose deal with this drug. The comedown was fine, and I did some coke about an hour and a half after taking the second half of the second pill. The coke felt good, and after a short while I was hardly feeling any effects from the pills. I smoked some weed and went to sleep, and the next day I didn&#039;t really have a hangover.<br /><br />Overall this drug was fun, although a little underwhelming with its duration. Maybe higher doses are the trick, but before I do that I&#039;m going to message the vendor that sold me these &quot;MDMA&quot; pills and see what they say about my problem. Hopefully they are cooperative and we will be able to work something out. I also want to make sure that they&#039;re not selling these pills as MDMA any more.<br /><br />I just want some fucking MDMA pills after all…is that too much to ask?!<br /><br />To the community out there, what do you think was in these pills? I&#039;ve narrowed it down to mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone [4-MMC] ) or methylone (bk-MDMA) due to the effects the substance had on me. I personally think it&#039;s mephedrone as it didn&#039;t last as long as methylone supposedly does, and it had slightly different characteristics based off trip reports that I&#039;ve read. <br /><br />I appreciate any comments that anyone might like to give ;)<br />- JH

				That sucks, I use reputable vendors only and do my research before ordering. I guess at times bad pills can get mixed in but I prefer mdma powder in this day and age. I hope you get what you actually want, good luck on the road.

				unless you had a test kit, you cant say those rolls didnt have mdma in them.<br /><br />from what you described, it was mdma. the fact that you doubted the experience from the get-go probably provided you with the slightly negative headspace for your experience.<br /><br />or... you know..... i could be wrong&nbsp; ::)

				If you smell the pills and it smells like a chemical fish wastebin, it probably contains Mephedrone lol. It has an extremely distinctive smell.

				This definitely sounds like mephedrone.&nbsp; You can certainly redose with it, but at a certain point you&#039;re just getting stimulated without euphoria.

				Thanks for the input guys.<br />I&#039;m 100% sure these weren&#039;t MDMA as I&#039;ve rolled on clean molly more times than I can count, and these pills definitely weren&#039;t the same. I&#039;m picking up a Marquis test kit soon and will test the pills just to make sure, but there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that they weren&#039;t molly. Mephedrone shouldn&#039;t react with a Marquis test kit by my research, am I right?.<br /><br />As for the vendor, I&#039;ve sent them a PM on the main site and am waiting their reply, however their profile says they haven&#039;t been online for a few days. Should I disclose who it is (considering they have &gt;95% feedback and have had an account for a few months), or should I wait to see if the vendor goes online in the next couple of days and responds to my message? <br />- JH

				I would just disclose who they are! Not much harm in that because you don&#039;t have any solid proof yet but when you do have proof that these may not have MDMA in them, they&#039;re going to have to be named + shamed anyway for miss-selling product.

Or at a rave with your closest friends. <br />Also I agree with Dingo on the comeup times, usually start feeling tingly hands and light body within 20/30mins. Then about 15minutes later I&#039;m up fully! <br />But usually an MDMA dose lasts me way over 3 hours. Not an hour and a half!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My usual MDMA high lasts for 3-4 hours, but has been up to 6 hours and also only about 1.5 - 2 hours. The time it went for 1.5-2 hours was when I was worrying a lot about things that day and also perhaps due to using MDMA just 2 weeks earlier (Usually I wait 1 month in between). Still felt the speedy part of it properly though.<br /><br />Everyone is different so come up times / length of high / the whole experience will be different on everyone and every time you take it.

				I am just going to echo what others said. <br /><br />Get a test kit! :P <br /><br />Dancesafe ( amazingly fast shipping ) or bunkpolice if you want to go clear-net.<br />Just drop the $25-50 to test your chems. That way your not playing russian roulette with your mind and body.<br />A test kit should be a prerequisite to any drug or chemical purchase imo...<br /><br />There are usually reagents available for purchase on SR as well.<br /><br />Peace!

				Like you said, test what you have on hand.. <br /><br />&nbsp;BUT.. I would say Bk-MDMA /Methalone You pretty much nailed it spot on for what its like.. <br /><br />BTW... If oyu have ever had REAL MDMA you wont mistake Bk-MDMA for it.. so YEAH he could say that he knows its not MDMA.. While they are in the same family and peopletend to say BK is MDMA lite its still not the same

				I just recently had a vendor try and pass off methylone as MDMA. Didn&#039;t work.. Stuff was very short lived.

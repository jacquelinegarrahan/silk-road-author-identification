				&quot;SRAdmin&quot; &amp; &quot;SR Staff&quot; these are the names of the accounts held by a stupid scammer.<br /><br />I mean stupid in the sense that he thinks people would fall for such obvious scam mail.... But then I realize maybe I am stupid for thinking that people are not stupid enough to fall for these scams.... Anyway if you have fallen for this you are stupid and also make me look stupid for thinking no one would fall for them.<br /><br />Here they are for your amusement :)<br /><br />SRAdmin - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />Silk Road has decided to move on with a new venture, a new Silk Road. We have listened to sellers feedback from here and the forums and with the amount of buyer scams on the rise we have decided to act. On the 1st of April we will be launching Silk Road 2.0 as a separate site to the main site. This site will be invite only and work on a web of trust method.<br /><br />As one of our high ranking, trusted sellers we are inviting you to participate and be amongst the few to join. Sellers will be recruited from the main site when we feel they have gained our trust that they are reputable sellers. Buyers will in the first instance be recruited on their seller stats (min 6 months, minimal refund &amp; auto finalize, $1500+ sales) thereafter they will only be invited by you, the sellers. This will be the web of trust working to best effect.<br /><br />We will have a quick ban policy on any scams or scammers and they will not be able to re-join for at least 3 months (If invited again) We are hoping to provide a safer, more productive site for you, our trusted sellers. We also hope because of the way the site will work we will see a better community evolve, and larger deals being able to be placed. Silk Road will still run in conjunction with Silk Road 2.0<br /><br />The Site is due to go live on the 31st of March 2013 with an announcement on the forum at the same time, the reason we have kept it quiet so far is that we expect a lot of debate about the site on the forum as until sellers begin to invite their customers the people allowed to join will be limited. We ask that you do not mention it to your customers until this time.<br /><br />As a trusted vendor the fee for joining with this invite is 2btc (~$100) after the 1st of April the fee will be the same as the main site. Your unique btc address to send the payment to is 17UcDKHtusuSijELtFxqpw2p8dYFvQARuU<br /><br />Once the payment has been matched and confirmed you will receive the address of the new page with a link to register and build your store. please do not release the address until after 31st March.<br /><br /><br />We hope you join us in this new and exciting venture<br /><br /><br />Silk Road Admin<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />SR Staff - <br />Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Inigo. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Silk Road.<br /><br />Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.<br /><br />I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR &amp; GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with DPR&#039;s forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138016.0 Or message him here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/b1e30b5819 Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200&#039;000 per month or $2&#039;400&#039;000 annually Shares will be priced at $500 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc (see below) at Mt. Gox&#039;s weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br /><br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your SR account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br /><br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it.<br /><br />Payment address - 1F48CymZsof76oZob8UiCAaz7P4yUdnz7M<br /><br />If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.<br /><br />Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging SR Financial here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/733d1d49e8 with your Transaction ID, User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.<br /><br />Example<br />Subject - SR Investments<br />#277349296<br />Inigo<br />4 x 0.1<br />฿29.20<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck<br /><br /><br />Inigo<br />SR Staff

We have listened to sellers feedback from here and the forums and with the amount of buyer scams on the rise we have decided to act. On the 1st of April we will be launching Silk Road 2.0 as a separate site to the main site. This site will be invite only and work on a web of trust method.<br /><br />As one of our high ranking, trusted sellers we are inviting you to participate and be amongst the few to join. Sellers will be recruited from the main site when we feel they have gained our trust that they are reputable sellers. Buyers will in the first instance be recruited on their seller stats (min 6 months, minimal refund &amp; auto finalize, $1500+ sales) thereafter they will only be invited by you, the sellers. This will be the web of trust working to best effect.<br /><br />We will have a quick ban policy on any scams or scammers and they will not be able to re-join for at least 3 months (If invited again) We are hoping to provide a safer, more productive site for you, our trusted sellers. We also hope because of the way the site will work we will see a better community evolve, and larger deals being able to be placed. Silk Road will still run in conjunction with Silk Road 2.0<br /><br />The Site is due to go live on the 31st of March 2013 with an announcement on the forum at the same time, the reason we have kept it quiet so far is that we expect a lot of debate about the site on the forum as until sellers begin to invite their customers the people allowed to join will be limited. We ask that you do not mention it to your customers until this time.<br /><br />As a trusted vendor the fee for joining with this invite is 2btc (~$100) after the 1st of April the fee will be the same as the main site. Your unique btc address to send the payment to is 17UcDKHtusuSijELtFxqpw2p8dYFvQARuU<br /><br />Once the payment has been matched and confirmed you will receive the address of the new page with a link to register and build your store. please do not release the address until after 31st March.<br /><br /><br />We hope you join us in this new and exciting venture<br /><br /><br />Silk Road Admin<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />SR Staff - <br />Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Inigo.

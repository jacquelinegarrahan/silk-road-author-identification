				I bought some ketamine from a vendor and i thought the quality was only okaay caompared to the ketamine from marcelketman or symbosis. It took alot more of the ketamine to get fucked up so i left the following feedback: 5/5 &quot;Stealth was incredible. Really good. I&#039;ve made a fair amount of purchases on SR and this stealth was really good compared to others.<br />Quality of the K was okay I guess. I dont think its cut but the quality isnt as good as the ketamine I&#039;ve gotten from other vendors. But if you need some ketamine quick and your in the USA this guy has quick shipping&quot;<br /><br />about an hour the later the vendor messages me ther following message: &quot;that was a really lousy blow at the product quality. you basically saying that it was subpar at best. thanks! really odd since I&#039;ve gotten rave reviews about the product: from so many others&quot;<br /><br />Why cant i leave an honest review on someones feedback, isnt that the whole point of the feedback? I still gave him a 5/5 but i just thought i&#039;d let people know there is much better ketamine out there and i know because i&#039;ve tried them all myself! I dont want to get onto any vendors blacklist so should i just tell him I&#039;ll change the feedback?

				This feedback thing has to change. Imagine if vendors actually had to earn a 5 by bringing together quality, quantity, service, support, etc. How great would that be. A good vendor would get a 3 or 4. An exceptional vendor would have a 4.5 average and be proud. Instead, 5 means &quot;Didn&#039;t completely fuck up&quot;. Even if it&#039;s late by a few days we&#039;re supposed to leave a 5. This system is broken.

				I agree!&nbsp; IMO it should jump up to 10 and anything above 7.5 means they do their job quite well.&nbsp; 8.5-9 is a straight up go to guy!&nbsp; I agree it&#039;s a flawed system but I also agree it does work.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t buy from anyone below a 90, most of the time higher than that!&nbsp; I see both sides of it, if we changed it to what I mentioned above it could easily turn into what it is now.&nbsp; Vendors would strive to be at the top with threats and retaliation so it&#039;s taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp; Yes it&#039;s flawed but is it really fixable??&nbsp; Lets hear from some others on what their fix would be to the system of reviews?!

				What an unprofessional response. A competent distributor should never address a courteous client such as yourself in the manner this individual has. Quite unbelievable.

				Feedback was fine. In fact, that&#039;s the way you do it. You leave a 5/5 because you received what you ordered. But you comment about any aspect of the transaction in the comment field. That&#039;s the info buyers want to know about. <br /><br />Well done. Hold your head up high and go on about your day proud that you did it right.

				FUCK THIS GUY!!!<br /><br />Your feedback was YOUR OPINION and as you said it was an honest one...There i something worse on this site then a whining vendor about feedback. And actually your feedback was great...as it actually was feedback....you covered everything and gave&nbsp; a full review...not just a &quot;5/5 it was good thanks&quot;.<br /><br />His response is one where I would go back and edit it and leave a 1/5 and then message him &quot; are you happy now......loser&quot; and i would leave it for at least a day...then message him back...&quot;I am going to change it back to my original feed back because I am not a dick nor a liar. I told the truth about how I felt...and I do not mind you questioning my feedback as to&nbsp; how you can do better...but I do not like you questioning it as to cry about the honest truth I give you.I can&#039;t speak for others...only myself..<br /><br />But as you saw with the feedback I left the last 24 hours...That is what I could have left...though it would have been a lie... that is something I wont do. The bottom line is I think your quality is sub par...but if I was in a pinch and needed something tomorrow and I wanted to make sure it was stealth...I would go to you...but after this...I won&#039;t be..Good luck with your business...you just lost a customer&quot;<br /><br />No buyer should ever feel pressured to leave a certain feedback. leave the truth. Just do not be a dick for no reason. And by no means did it sound like you are. Vendors should earn their 5/5. And it sounds like he did everything in his power to be 5/5...it&#039;s just to you...the product was like a step above shit. And you do not like shit. <br /><br />Also you did the right thing in leaving a 5/5 still but commenting on the quality. In fact I would say your feedback was the exact way newbies should leave it. And the vendor should have said &quot; Thanks for your feedback...I am glad you gave me a 5/5 even though you were not happy with the quality. I am sorry about that..as you can see I have plenty of customers that liked the quality. But I guess you got a bad batch....if you order again I will give you 25% off and free shipping so you can see it was just a bad sample and I carry quality shit. As you saw I try my&nbsp; hardest to be the best..And I have done so with my packaging and my shipping speed...and you will see with your next&nbsp; order that the normal quality of my shit is A+. And if you get bad shit again...all I can say is FUCK OFF&nbsp; &nbsp;;D&quot; have a good day and again I am sorry bro.<br /><br />That would have made you happy...made you try him again...and he would have done the right thing...but so many of these vendors do not get customer service. <br /><br />YOU keep doing reviews how your doing...YOU clearly GET IT and are doing great as a buyer.

				You did the right thing. Thing is, just calling someone&#039;s product subpar - especially if they&#039;re new or the product listing is new - can cost them $$$$. It&#039;s just business and they should know that, but not everyone is a zen master.<br /><br />Some feedbacks I see are nit-picky or they&#039;re just plain mad over something small. I rather have a wider selection of vendors to choose from and experiment with; that means selling here has to be as welcoming as possible. And a more intense feedback system? That wouldn&#039;t achieve much for the consumer and would cause some vendors to quit the Road (they&#039;re already more stressed and paranoid than any personal buyer, minus the benzo vendors?..).<br /><br />Compared to something like Topix, the Road has the best buyer protection anyone could dream of, considering what&#039;s being sold. Plus, fucking refunds?! Ebay/paypal refunds are a bitch. <br /><br />Not saying we shouldn&#039;t be absolutely truthful in the feedbacks, but we should completely understand why vendors are sensitive about it. I&#039;m accurate in my feedbacks but always upbeat on purpose. Then again I do my research before making any order, so haven&#039;t had many duds.

I didn&#039;t know he was small time too, if someone&#039;s doing 30+ orders a day you can be blunt as hell and they probably won&#039;t even notice or care much, but doing some good karma for a new or small vendor can help them eventually be one of the big guys, afford better product, branch out into new products, etc... For security and consistency I almost always buy from top sellers exclusively; it&#039;s hard for a vendor to get in that bubble.

Occasionally when I find cocaine, I can tell the good from the bad. <br /><br />Quality should be an important part of a review. Especially for something that can be easily cut like a white powder. <br /><br />Just like the estimated potency of a tab should be part of a review. Whether or not that potency can match up to the listing. (This is harder to judge I think, but you can certainly tell to some degree how much you took, if you have enough experience).

				That guy&#039;s an idiot. You did the right thing I think, even though the product wasn&#039;t as expected, you left a 5/5 for great delivery, which is the most important part of any transaction, but actually mentioned about the quality in the comment part. It can hurt his business if people see the quality is just OK, but that&#039;s how free (black)market works, and the vendor should know about it. He can&#039;t come at you like that and expect anything in return but his ruined credibility, brute force just doesn&#039;t really work here :P<br /><br />Indeed the rating system is broken, but still is worth a lot of information on a vendor&#039;s credibility. You can&#039;t really rate delivery time as it&#039;s almost always random and depends on the courier service/country&#039;s post...Also, a vendor that will want to stick to his refund policy may get down rated because the buyer is mad for not reading the profile page and etc etc<br /><br />Something that COULD work a bit better imo is a rating system a bit like eBay where you could rate 1 to 5 on different aspects of the transaction such as customer service and quality...They could show up individually on the vendor profile&#039;s header (i.e. T5, has been a member for X years/months, top X%, Customer service X%, Product quality X%).<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t buy anything from someone who&#039;s above 95, and leave a 5/5 unless the transaction is really shitty. <br /><br />

T5 really is a team though, we have several people working together to make it work as flawlessly as possible, therefore I might not be the one with who you&#039;ve been talking to on SilkRoad (I&#039;m not Shag who manages customer service).

				I agree as a buyer the rating system is frustrating, there isn&#039;t a whole lot of differentiation available and there are no criteria laid out for each possible response. I feel like this creates a scenario in which buyers may not even know what to rate their experience as. This, coupled with the fact that vendors seemingly put pressure on their buyers to keep up their ratings makes the experience less than ideal. On the one hand I feel for the vendors, as I will be one myself in the next day or two. Vendors work very hard to get people to trust them and any bad feedback is potential customers lost. In this case I think you did the right thing for the system that is in place. Don&#039;t trash the vendor with a low score, but be honest about the quality he provided. The real answer seems to be revamping the feedback system to incorporate different aspects of the buyer experience and a more defined group of choices than 1,2,3,4, or 5. This would be difficult though, as the feedback already in place is what a lot of vendors depend on. Even if the new system was in place and the old results were still there, new buyers may be confused as to how the 1-5 system fell into place working as it does now. What do you guys think is the best middle ground solution?

				little off topic but I am curious, as a vendor is it acceptable to contact people who are unhappy with the service provided and ask for specific feedback to improve? <br /><br />If yes, is it then acceptable to ask a former purchaser if they would be willing to give you another try (send a free tester with improvements made) ?

				Even though most vendors are doing a great job getting product to us, the potency of some of their merchandise is definitely not the grade a lot of us medicinal patients are and have grown accustomed to from dispensaries. So an honest rating system, is all we have to go on to determine a vendors quality, unless we take their word for it.

				Unless I do not get my package, or if I&#039;m shorted or if product is not what they say it is are the only reasons I would ever give less than a 5/5, but shit you can say whatever you want on the feedback.

				Honestly OP, I&#039;m more inclined to assume the quality of the K and it&#039;s impact on you would have a lot more to do with tolerance, mindset and body chemistry, as a couple have already mentioned; that was the first thing I thought when you mentioned the quality review going in the feedback.<br /><br />My take has always been that a 5/5 rating is you ordered, you received, it&#039;s what you ordered, transaction complete. Good, prompt communication during the transit period is also another gold star.<br /><br />When the margin of quality is separated by either &quot;Not bad&quot; and &quot;Pretty good&quot;, then I would honestly leave that out of the feedback section and discuss the quality with the vendor first hand.<br /><br />It is always a better option to simply contact the vendor first and ask questions, discuss how the product felt and try to organise a better sample or another product for a better price, most vendors are willing to arrange something so everybody wins, obviously just don&#039;t demand free shit.<br /><br />On the flip side, this vendor did in fact act like a douche, and you should go find his mom and give her a good rogering up the anus, that oughta learn him.

				Price shouldnt matter. This is a free market and people can charge however nuch they want to. If someone is charging too much there will always be someone who will come along with a cheaper product to make money.<br />And anyways why would you rate on price? If you bought it, then obviously you like the price!<br />And for ppl who are checking out seller, they dont need your feedback about the vendors price, they can see the price themselves on the vendors page

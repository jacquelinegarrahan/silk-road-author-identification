				Hi,<br /><br />In case Silk Road appears to be receiving a DOS attack (which it probably is) I have a very good idea of how they are doing it and can propose a solution. Information on the attack and how it can be prevented can be provided. All apache versions are vulnerable, and traditional network security equipment like IPSs are useless against the attack. But there are software solutions to the problem.<br /><br />Someone who is at least mod PM me if you&#039;re interested in the information. I don&#039;t want to disclose the information publicly here because it will give people ideas, although I&#039;m sure some others in the more computer security conscious crowd here may be aware of it. This exploit is publicly available, but rarely used. The exploit is low bandwidth and works perfectly through Tor (so you can use it to anonymously take down clearnet sites too).

				The solution isn&#039;t upgrading apache, it&#039;s putting something in between apache and the rest of the world.<br /><br />2.2.22 is the nearly the most up to date of the 2.2.x branch (2.2.23 is latest). It will likely be more stable (and likely have less vulnerabilities) than 2.4.x branch which is less mature and introduces less mature features.<br /><br />Higher version numbers are not always better in the world of running production servers!<br /><br />2.2.23 does contain 2 security fixes (albeit for obscure situations) so they should get on to that

				The best is to put all in static file (cache system, update when new activity) <br /><br />Use nginx and not apache<br /><br />And all will be good, they can handle a big ddos with nginx if more than 70% of the site is on static file.<br /><br />

				Sound like a massive headache of a solution to me. There are too many dynamic components to the website to do it effectively, you need a static copy generated for every user on every account action, every product update for EVERY user and every config of domestic only/sort by X/Y/Z etc...<br /><br />You could remove some of these features to make it possible, but PHP dynamic site is so much less dev time and much less strenuous in terms of total CPU/memory/disk, just not query latency.

				How to give karma to other users anyway?&nbsp; BTW-&nbsp; Bravo on this thread!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Like I was saying in a different thread.&nbsp; Just think how many highly paid black-ops hackers from the military that the gubberment is using right now to exploit and/or fuck with SR right now.<br /><br />The US gubberment has a bunch of those fuckers on this I&#039;ll guarantee!&nbsp; <br /><br />We need to out think the military intelligent folks if we are going to survive this people.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />That&#039;s why I keep recommending that all of the community get behind an opensource project that will be able to help DPR learn from other coders.<br />You know, even though it is a parallel project, DPR doesn&#039;t need to reveal anything of his to the community unless he wants to.&nbsp; But we can contribute our knowledge on a parallel project and DPR&#039;s team can steal from the opensource project. <br /><br />I think DPR ought to donate 1000 BTC for a bounty on this actually.&nbsp; It would do nothing but benefit him and protect his investment.&nbsp; (and maybe create a little healthy competition.

				You have to understand the position that DPR is presently in.&nbsp; He is some guy probably middle aged, who got in to coding and wrapped up a pretty righteous setup.&nbsp; He&#039;s probably a biker/geek and he is probably not doing all levels of current coding standards.&nbsp; He probably pieced SR together and BTW did a fucking amazing job.&nbsp; But most companies that deal with shit like this have a whole fucking team of experts working on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />DPR while he is probably a likable guy, probably worries about people rating him out if he trusts them.&nbsp; You never know how money or the threat of losing ones freedom will change someone from friend to foe.&nbsp; &nbsp;So he probably relies on a VERY VERY small team.&nbsp; Most of which are working with him remotely.&nbsp; &nbsp;DPR is probably implementing the code changes by himself on a test server.&nbsp; While the main production server is presently overloaded with a DDOS attack or something of that sort.<br /><br />He is currently backed into a corner.&nbsp; There is something important he is lacking, like the change to the web server software perhaps, and if we just keep these threads going with obvious suggestions.&nbsp; &nbsp;And trust me, if we know how to do one thing or another, the gubberment probably already knows as well.&nbsp; So I think it&#039;s safe to share most things in public as far as suggestions for DPR.<br />As long as we give him quality advice, and he can test it in a test environment with some stress testing in a LAN. <br />Then apply the same fixes to the production server once he has perfected them.&nbsp; I think our generic advise could really help him.<br /><br /><br />The best and pretty much only advice I&#039;ve saw so far is;&nbsp; &quot;Use nginx and not apache&quot;<br /><br />

He could have under estimated and for all we know the server went down once more. <br /><br />unless we know the exact config and set up of the SR network then its no good to say &quot;hey DDOS&quot; or &quot;Hey LE&quot;..ect. Its all speculation and nothing more. It creates more worry and even the forum is messing up, too many people! did we not forget about TOR? unless you have your own bridge then your sharing a connection with everyone (in one sense or the other). How many jumps do you make with TOR? <br /><br />Sit back, use common sense and at worst your understanding of social engineering to read between the lines.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s why I recommend DPR and or other benefactors of SilkRoad investing money into fueling an open source project.&nbsp; Have a few developers step up.&nbsp; Help the project out.&nbsp; Collect donations, and divide the donations equally.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the security of the data of the users of this site, and for the security of the this market continuing on passed our involvement during our short life spans.<br /><br />BIT WASP is a good nominee for a start of this endeavor.&nbsp; <br />https://github.com/Bit-Wasp<br /><br />Getting a team of developers interested in this is my next goal.&nbsp; I imagine some people already are working on this project behind the scenes.&nbsp; &nbsp;But they are not likely to release the source code.&nbsp; Rather it&#039;s too tempting for many developers to just corner the market a little with their new inventions.

				The Tor network is pretty bandwidth crippled as is, DOS from too many legit requests is unlikely. I&#039;ve been raping the shit out of these forums bandwidth wise way more than I ever would SR, and it&#039;s fine.<br /><br />Nginx might well be susceptible to the same attack, in fact I think it is (might download and test to confirm). The problem isn&#039;t apache being too bloated or anything, it&#039;s server connections being tied up in a very clever way. You can DOS some proxy server software in a similar way too.<br /><br />The only web server I know that is immune to this particular attack is IIS 6 and up.

				Hi,<br /><br />Yes you can&#039;t use a classical DDOS on Tor due to the TCP characteristics but there are other tools you can use to DOS a server.<br /><br />Slowloris is one of the example that is not a TCP DOS, so compatible with the Tor Network, and there are others possibilities also...<br /><br />http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/<br /><br />So yes you can technically perform a DOS on Tor.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean that this is what is currently happening to SR, like many others i don&#039;t know, I just wanted to make the point that it is possible...

				Nginx is vulnerable to this attack too, but less so than Apache, especially at default config settings. Needs a higher request rate, but there&#039;s nothing stopping you from running 500 Tor clients on a decent PC with a decent internet connection. How susceptible each particular server is depends on configuration values of the server.

				Hmm just realised another attack vector could be requesting the generation of a fuck load of CAPTCHAs - image processing is very expensive compared to anything else the site is doing, especially when you&#039;re doing it through PHP, this might explain why the CAPTCHA is down to 3 numbers now (to lighten the load), but I still suspect network troubles over CPU exhaustion.<br /><br />The server is at least up still, just access is very intermittent. I think the web server (at least software, maybe the whole server) has been reset regularly while SR was still up, I kept getting logged out (session invalidated) whereas back a couple of weeks ago I could stay logged into SR on a session for weeks (a silly thing to do I know, but at least it was possible and the account wasn&#039;t used for any purchasing/incriminating).<br /><br />Debugging an anonymous server over Tor is hard lol

				The guy posted messages supposedly from DPR with invalid signatures. Somebody&#039;s having a good troll.<br /><br />Even if the guy had a valid password hash, it may very well be for his own password, in which case guessing the hash isn&#039;t too hard! That&#039;s assuming passwords aren&#039;t salted here.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get why people value password salting and even hashing so much - if you compromise the server you can just log the plain text coming into the server, no need to crack hashes! I use randomly gen passwords for everything for this reason.

				Hi,<br /><br />First you have no clue of what is happening if you are not among the admins, so DOS or hacking is a possibility but nothing is confirmed.<br /><br />Yes it is the usual hacking business to blackmail companies or admins of servers while you DOS their server but the hackers way is often more &quot;low profile&quot; so the post in the forums is kind of strange and could come for anyone even not related to an attack...<br /><br />@bicofone : you are right with the Captcha possibility but I don&#039;t think it could so completely overload the whole SR login page as the captcha is loaded as an image and does not imply so much resources.<br /><br />The whole thing definitely looks like a DOS attack of slowloris &quot;type&quot;, the DOS of a server could easily lead to some unexpected things like a mess with Captcha, and the tendency to limit the resources on the server lately is a benediction in this case.<br /><br />This is only an hypothesis but it fits very well in the situation...

				We are very much on a similar wavelength TheMonk. <br /><br />alberthofmann, is IPcop any good at layer 7 (app layer) defense? Most firewalls do sweet fuck all at preventing them, usual defense is shitty signature based IPSs but these only stop the script kiddies. I believe this downtime is due to a layer 7 attack going on what little information I know about the operation of SR servers and the fair bit I know about Tor and DOS attacks in general.<br /><br />There are ways to defend against these attacks, and they just involve filtering the traffic before it reaches the web server.<br /><br />

				I think we won&#039;t bring solution ourself, I don&#039;t feel my knowledge is sufficient enough to give some advice, but if this is indeed some kind of DoS atacks, the first way would be to search some academic papers on matter, simple googling[basic, not in google schoolar] show something like this:<br />CLEARNET:<br />https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2008-November/015695.html<br />http://fc09.ifca.ai/papers/43_Detecting_dos_in_tor.pdf

				Hi<br /><br />I completely agree with bincofone, forget about simple Ip filtering and the Microsoft TMG, Ip filtering is not possible on Tor like on normal networks, and for these kind of attacks on Tor a Microsoft Firewall won&#039;t be a real help.<br /><br />IF, it is still IF, it is a DOS of slowloris type there are not much a lot of solutions but complexify the login with a second layer and add a verification of the fact that HTTP requests are full and reject the incomplete requests that are the base of this type of DOS.<br /><br />Again we are just &quot;talking&quot; about this possibility, nobody here can be sure of anything except the technical Team and DPR.

I made with IPcop the best experience and please dont think that IPcop can just block IPs. I would prefer creating and using a network isolated environment with Whonix and IPcop under Virtualbox or VMware so no one can attack this isolated network. Its the best choice that would be worked fine. I learned this from people which build company and school networks just without the Whonix. The Whonix Gateway got a software firewall on top and with the Whonix Workstation it is the non plus ultra, because you are like a ghost on the internet. If anyone got a better and more secure choice write it down here please. hopefully DPR will read this Topic and think about it. I think if I send him PM he would read this next week, because of the many spam from the kiddz... @DPR please let the SilkRoad never die and I pray for you not to get busted!

				I&#039;m pretty sure Whonix and IPcop won&#039;t protect you from application vulnerabilities like SQL injections. SQL injections of course being a lot worse than a DOS vulnerability, but you get the picture.<br /><br />There are reverse HTTP proxies you can use out to sort out these problems by rejecting the exploit requests outright (if indeed that is there attack vector, which I highly suspect it is from all the evidence - and it&#039;s what I&#039;d use if I was doing it). As to the exact crafting of the exploit, I can&#039;t be sure, whatever it is it&#039;s good enough to get past whatever network defense SR has. Could be a script kiddie or a talented hacker.

I think everyone would be know that just connection with TOR through Whonix is not secure and anonymously. It is written by the welcome message from the gateway.<br /><br />HTTP? are you serious? ...<br />What is not ok with IPcop? it is possible to build OpenVPN connections and another virtual IPCOP or physical IPCOP&nbsp; at the end of the chain. <br />with a few whonix workstations build OpenSSH Tunnel. <br /><br />A useful trick is &quot;ssh -tt&quot; which forces tty allocation, so instead of the above you can do the following, connecting to server2 via firewall as the jump host:<br /><br />ssh -tt firewall.example.com ssh -tt server2.example.org<br /><br />This opens an ssh terminal to the remote machine. You can also pass commands. For example, to reattach to a remote screen session using screen you can do the following:<br /><br />ssh -tt firewall.example.com ssh -tt server2.example.org screen -x<br /><br />The chain can be arbitrarily long and is not limited to just two hosts.<br />Hope this could be helpful for the pirates.&nbsp;

				The problem is likely HTTP requests that are mal-formed. This is why you use a HTTP reverse proxy, as we are talking a site running on port 80 we all access using web browsers. IPCop will likely have no idea blocking certain HTTP requests is necessary (unless you can add bad packet signatures (which can be bypassed) or something similar to it).

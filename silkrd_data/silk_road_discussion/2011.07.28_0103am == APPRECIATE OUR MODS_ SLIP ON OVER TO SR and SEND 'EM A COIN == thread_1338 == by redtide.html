				Ah. Now I know who else to send some BTC to besides SR.&nbsp; :) I enjoy the forums and find them VERY helpful. It has helped me to avoid a few questionable vendors and improve myself as well. I recognize the hours of hard work and DEDICATION it takes to keep us informed and safe. From security to rumors and everything in between. It&#039;s a lot of work on everyone&#039;s part. Very cool work you all do. I thank you in writing and look forward in the near future to showing you all a little BTC appreciation, lol. ;) Stay cool and check your inbox.

				A vending machine in Japan w/ pictures of nomad bloodbath in his boxers on it. Four pic or so on the sides. Two in tighty whities and two in boxers. All in different poses or state of supposed semi-undress. Oh, and the vending machine sells his undergarments too. Each one has a different pic of him doing something. Getting dressed, gardening&nbsp; :)(LOL), moderating, out and about around town. Buying groceries, crossing the street, waiting at a crosswalk, hailing a bus or cab. ALL in his boxers. Too funny! And when that catches on, we go international. With the machines and nomad!! We see nomad in his boxers at the boxing match in Mexico. In his tighty whities at an MMA event,maybe? Carnival?&nbsp; The possibilities are endless. Vending machine takes BTC, cash and C.Cards.<br /><br />Maybe some light green ones.... Hmmmm

				Im the last person to have my hand out, but Nomad has a point. The mods are here for the good of the community. I would be here if I received donations or not. I really appreciate all those that have donated or even just said thank you.<br /><br />As mods, we volunteered our time and dont expect to get paid. That said, being a mod is 10 times harder than it seems. No matter what happens, Ill always be here to help. But give what you can, even a thank you note is great. But, this is a very time consuming project and every bit counts. While Im not saying that I want money, I just wanted to point out what Nomad was trying to say. He puts in a lot of time with very little in return. <br /><br />Granted, we all volunteered our time, but I don&#039;t think we all realized the time it takes to keep this site up and going.<br /><br />All Im saying is if you are in a position to give,&nbsp; please do so, if not, a thank you would be great. just knowing that what we do is appreciated is awesome.&nbsp; I dont want to sound like I have my hand out, I dont. I just want to point out that it takes a lot of time and effort to keep the boards up to date and runnning. <br /><br />I think Nomad is correct when he wants to charge a bitcoin (or whatever) for every question answered. He probably has 50 or more pm&#039;s in his box daily, and thats on the light end.<br /><br />So give if&nbsp; you can, but dont feel guilty if you cant. We volunteered our time. To take some of the heat of Nomad, why dont some of you send me a pm and Ill see if I cant answer your questions. IF I cant, Im sure I can find the answer (ill ask Nomad, Just kidding,lol)<br /><br />Thanks for letting be part of a great community!<br /><br />CP

				I really think that forum need more mod. With all respect, nomad is sick, digitalalch absent and CP can not do all alone and on global time.<br />There is a thread where member ask for information about no SR issue and posted name and address which can not be allowed.<br />Please, SR try to find more&nbsp; moderator&nbsp; for our safety and privacy.<br />I dont have objection to pay monthly fee to a moderators so they can have at least something for hard work.<br />This is not ordinary forum and many members can have problems with the law so payment for moderation can be consider as reasonable action.<br />btw<br />&quot;Report to moderator&quot; option does not work (getting error message)

				I agree.&nbsp; This is not an easy forum.&nbsp; It was probably fun for mods the first day or two, but I got a feeling that fun can wear off, and it can be a pain.&nbsp; We get serious craziness on here, not to mention ripoffs and possible LE hassle if we don&#039;t play right.&nbsp; Mods on here are all we got, and we need them bad.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed lately how grateful I am for these guys, and even tho they are friends of mine, and we&#039;ve already walked thru a bit on here, I like to help out when I can, and I encourage others to do the same.&nbsp; Good job fellahs... :)

				Thank you everyone for the&nbsp; insane generosity.<br />As a community we have proved then when people are held to a common set of ideals, and professionalism we can truly see meritocracy at its finest.&nbsp; Many of us, Vendors &amp; Mods alike, have gone way above the normal call of duty helping to serve people with quality and service in&nbsp; a war against personal freedom. We have created a wonderful community.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				&nbsp;;D That&#039;s great. I am laughing so hard. LMAO!! AND the winner is.... ME! Lol. Thanks to everyone who participated. It was a lot of fun and profitable for me.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Hahaha. Fastest deposit goes to me. I just beat mrgrey. Dudes quick. Although his deposit was larger than mine.&nbsp; :) Honestly I waited until the minute and made the largest deposit. So I do not have to shell out for that new car. Shwooo. <br /><br />So basically I won. But in the interest of fairness I will give mrgrey one shot at the prize pool. Hey Rod! &quot;Yes.&quot;&nbsp; Tell him what he didn&#039;t win.&nbsp; Lets look behind Curtain #1. &quot;A fabulous trip!&quot; 5days4nights in scenic Cancun. Cancun, Montana. You would have stayed at the fabulous 1 Horn Stag Plaza. AKA: NotelMotel. Free continental breakfast. You catch it and they will cook it. Free tick and Lyme disease vaccinations. Too bad you missed out on that one. Lets see what else you didn&#039;t get.&nbsp; What&#039;s over our to our left? No! not a new car. &quot;Its a horse. Ready for the glue factory.&quot; Glad you didn&#039;t get that one. And now door #3. ARE YOU SURE you want door #3? &quot;Yes&quot; ok.&nbsp; Lets see what you got.&nbsp; Oh, whan whan whan. Oh no. Not door #3. You&#039;ve been assessed road taxes. Pay $40 per house and $115 per hotel you own. Sorry mrgrey. That sucks. Thanks for playing and we&#039;ll see you all again next time.&nbsp; :)

				&nbsp;:) I would LOVE too! This site is amazing! For the first time in like - FOR EVER! :) - Christmas has finally come! But I can not for the life of me figure out how to get &#039;coins&#039;. I down loaded my wallet and surfed around their web-site, but every link I clicked on past that - no longer exisited. The &#039;help&#039; button just showed the version of Bitcoin. I spent 48 hours trying to figure out Tor and Silk Road, but because I am severely dyslexic with any thing technical, I can&#039;t seem to find out how to complete my little transaction. So, please - if you can - if you know - how the heck can I buy bitcoins, and I&#039;ll pass it down! Thanx Oz

				I disappear once in a while, and then come back, and see site is going strong, and then I&#039;m all over the place, sometimes helping, sometimes being an idiot, and sometimes just wanting a little company, as a junky&#039;s life can be a lonely one.<br /><br />But I wanted to say once again, a big thankyou to the moderators, DigitalAlch, chronicpain, and nomad bloodbath who do so much to keep this site humming along.&nbsp; It can be a thankless job at times, and they get drawn into&nbsp; the fracas, and I wouldn&#039;t want to do this shit, so like another site I&#039;m thinking of, we gotta remember once in a while to show them a bit of gratitude.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know if you&#039;re like me, you aren&#039;t wealthy, but after a buy, sometimes u might have some btc sitting around, so help out.&nbsp; We shouldn&#039;t make them ask, we should let each other know, that it&#039;s appreciated if we do it without asking...no amount too small, no amount too large....(NEWBS: it&#039;s a good way to practice sending btc!&nbsp; u can send from online wallets too, this&#039;ll show you how to get their btc addresses from their profiles!)<br /><br /><br />so help the people that keep the sails trimmed around here. <br /><br />Thankyou!

				SR newbie over here too, but even after just lookin at this site for a few hours you can see you guys got something pretty amazing going on here. Definitely would be down to send over some coin to a mod. Kinda having some technical issue whenever I try to view a vendor&#039;s page. When I go to the url I&#039;m redirected to put in a login and captcha. I put my info in and do the captcha and everytime I do, &quot;Login Failed&quot;. Any suggestions? I&#039;d really like to start getting out there on some products. Thanks! :)

				I might have missed it being started, but I do wish you had a &#039;one click&#039; place we could send btc to the lot of you to be divided up...I think maybe more people would do that too...not saying that I don&#039;t occasionally get help from one specific mod, just think it would be handier, when we are in a giving mood...need a &#039;button&#039; that comes up on every page...keep that reminder there :)<br /><br />Great job, btw, and congrats to new mod, limetless<br /><br />EDIT: So is this pretty much true, then, there still is no &#039;general fund&#039; where we can just donate to all mods at once...???

				Just a huge thank you to those that donated.. Its appreciated VERY MUCH.. I know that ive seen some threads dissing the mods like we dont do anything. 1. WE ARE NOT PAID ONE BTC. 2. I have slowed down a tad due to real life issues, but do move/fix threads when i see them. 3. Just because you dont see a mod posting a lot doesn&#039;t mean that mod is not doing anything...<br /><br />Im not gripping at all. As it is, I spend 20-30 hours a week on the forums, sometimes more, sometimes less. It was a great idea adding the squidshepard (he does a lot of work, btw) and the newest mod, Limetless. He&#039;s a smart dude and has a lot to offer...<br /><br />I also dont expect money donations either, they are GREATLY appreciated, even those that cant and just give a thank you, is appreciated.. Granted, I have slowed down a tad the last couple months, but before that, i averaged about 60-80 hours a week moving, deleting threads.. I can only do what my time allows, I think that 20-40 hours a week volunteering is a lot....Especially if one needs to hold down a real life job..lol.<br /><br /><br />Once again, thank you!!!

				Ok I promised to donate to the mods whenI won 110BTC. But - I will honour that promise and start with sending 1 bitcoin to nomad bloodbath<br /><br />I pledge to donate at least the cost of a gram of top hash to each mod in the next few weeks.<br /><br />Or if you prefer an 8 ball, then best dream on! I&#039;m not poor but cannot even afford to get myself an 8 ball. Wife even had a little &#039;discusion of economics&#039; when I told her how much I would save buying 100 gram of Afghan Gold Seal! But I got some the lady some really nice coke and will chat to her about buying 100 gram of hash. I told her that if I keep buying 5 grams then I am basically throwing away a couple of grams of coke! She listens then! She aint no coke head! No way would Mr Red have a Mrs Red who was coked up everyday! She is a 3 times a year lady! Or a binger (like me) when in the USA and getting fat lines thrown at us by fast talking Mexican guys with tattoos and muscle definition and girlfriends who have nails that would do real damage! Most work hard - they do a little coke from time to time - like a drink and like English guys who wind them up and take the piss. Mexicans are nice people, its just unfortunate they are a major drug producing nation whose government has long lost the &#039;war&#039; on drugs. The &#039;cartels&#039; in Mexico make UK street gangs seems tame. But for the main part the cartels or mafias do NOT target tourists or &#039;gringos&#039;. But they murder cops, journalists and lawyers with apparent ease. It has to be said the price for making drugs illegal is FAR worse than they would be if drugs were legal. <br /><br />Anyhow nomad bloodbath - spend its only a 1 BTC but every little helps eh?<br /><br />Yours in appreciation - Red.&nbsp; :D<br /><br /><br />

				Hey mods,&nbsp; give a bit, when I can, but I wondered what you thought of my proposal:<br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25351.0#new<br /><br />We badly need a private heroin buyer&#039;s sub-fourm, and we&#039;d like it to be &#039;pay to join&#039; and we wondered if we could somehow have the donations go to you guys, if the forum were allowed?&nbsp; It would be a win win, that way...keep out the shills, and thro a few btc you&#039;all&#039;s way, too....I&#039;d be glad to pay 5 btc myself, for a private forum where we could discuss vendors without fear of reprisals.&nbsp; And maybe if we linked it to a dollar amount--say 20 bucks or so--then it would be well worth it...Hell, I&#039;ve lost over a thousand bucks already to scammers, and Heroin seems to be their favorite drug for big ripoffs, and this would really help us, and hopefully you guys would get some money out of it too...

				I like to use http://dailybitcoins.org/ for donations. It&#039;s only a small amount 99% of the time but it&#039;s still a donation. Sadly, it can be a pain in the arse to access via Tor due to a CAPTCHA requirement they implement every few refreshes, so you may have to use your regular browser to refresh and attempt to get a larger payout.

As much as I might have let on like i didn&#039;t like him the truth is I loved Blargrawr. I learned a lot from him and I will miss him. It&#039;s been on my mind since I read about it earlier. I really feel sorry and regretful that I didn&#039;t express it before he left. I never had the first clue he would leave. Blarg if you read this man please come back even if it&#039;s just to tell me to fuck off.<br /><br />I never cared if he liked me or not I still loved the fucker

				Don&#039;t worry, ralph123, BlarghRawr is apparently back (or else someone is squatting his username).&nbsp; I think he had been considering leaving for awhile and finally took the plunge and deleted his account.&nbsp; He is back now though -- unless, as I said, it&#039;s not really him.

				I&#039;am sorry to say that I haven&#039;t send donation for a while now :/<br />I believe that vendor&#039;s should send donation&#039;s more then buyer&#039;s, some change is always on account, and we all benefit from SR and forum.<br />Now I can&#039; log on SR, but I will send donation ASAP.<br /><br />Thanks for keeping this place in order :)

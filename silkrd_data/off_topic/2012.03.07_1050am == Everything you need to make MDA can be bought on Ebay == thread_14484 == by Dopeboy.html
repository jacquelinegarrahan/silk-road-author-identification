The cooled solution is then added in 200-300ml portions slowly into the pail over a period of 2-3 hours with constant stirring. The solution should turn to a frothy green color. Stir for 12 hours and a solid mass should form at the bottom of the bucket. [If it does not solidify, mix another 350g of hydroxylamine hcl with 500g water and add this to the reaction, then add another 1000ml methanol and stir for another 12 hours].<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/38572fb5bc9e0ebe69f506ecff698f97.jpg<br /><br />Filter out the solid and wash it thoroughly with water and let it dry.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/6892ce57754bc1037d3468fea9cfa194.jpg<br /><br />OXIME --&gt; AMIDE<br />300g of the dried product is added to a 2000ml flask along with 900ml xylene and 6g nickel acetate.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/025ff23454e00b0006e37bc99bc088ff.jpg<br /><br />This mixture is heated to 130C for 6 hours. Distill or boil off 300-400ml of the xylene and allow it to cool for 12 hours until it solidifies.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/63a5cdefc59770b428221a5d7bbe281e.jpg<br /><br />Recrystallize the product with hot xylene [or boiling water]. Dry the recrystallized product and grind in into an extremely fine dust in a coffee grinder. It is very important that is a very fine dust with small particle size.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/43ed083b3712d2bcf267a8e837c0ddee.jpg<br /><br />AMIDE --&gt; AMINE<br />Add 2000ml water and 1200ml bleach into a clean 4-liter plastic milk jug. Add 100g sodium hydroxide and shake it up well. Cool it in a fridge for several hours. Add 100g of the finely powdered product from the previous step to the milk jug. Shake this mixture up and place it in the fridge for 72 hours, shaking it every few hours [or as much as possible as often as possible]. Take it out of the fridge and let if sit at room temp for 24 hours, again shaking it up whenever you get the chance. Then place it in a hot water bath for 6-12 hours. It should be a milky orange color with tarry MDA base floating in it. Use a separatory funnel to extract the MDA base with xylene or toluene and discard the water layer. Next add diluted HCl acid until the pH of the water layer is 1 and discard the oil layer this time. Evaporate the acidified water layer in a pyrex baking tray. A kilo of the original substrate will yield about 250g of MDA.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/41b65ce3728efeaaa9151285d87b1e22.jpg<br /><br />Wash with acetone, using a metal putty/plaster knife to scrape and crush everything up.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/7d306e92c74e14d9462d4c169cb7cae9.jpg<br /><br />Recrystallize with acetone and water or your preferred method.<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/998334caefb178868ac6cf1c1623f7a4.jpg<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A kilo of the original substrate will yield about 250g of MDA.<br /><br />Original topic and discussion can be found at psychonaut.com<br />http://psychonaut.com/post-34173.html?f=43

				Have you done this dope boy? Some of those chemicals are watched, I assume you just count on getting lucky coming through customs to a PO box that isn&#039;t yours? What are the hardest parts? Why are more people not doing this and selling it as MDMA/MDA, is it profitable?

				Everybody at this site should be setting up labs in their homes. And this is the perfect synthesis to get started with this hobby due to it&#039;s simplicity and none of the chemicals are very watched. The more people who get involved with chemistry as a hobby, the less they&#039;ll be able to persecute us. Just don&#039;t talk about it, keep it to yourself. Ignore the cops and government propaganda, they are just using fear and intimidation to control you, just like any corrupt regime. Ignore them just like you ignore internet trolls, even speaking to them gives them power.<br /><br />As far as profits go... $500 for 250g of MDA you tell me if it&#039;s profitable.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />And I don&#039;t know how to do the ebook thing, but I&#039;ll look into it. If somebody has the time and know-how they should put this into pdf format and distribute it far and wide, all over the net. We need as many people as possible to become disobedient towards governments worldwide, and the next 4 years will be crucial.<br /><br />laboyglass.com has get glassware for those who are interested.

				I like the idea, for sure more people should be cooking at home but aside from the dangers of dodgy product, won&#039;t the corrupt government just ban alpha-methyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)hydrocinnamaldehyde or make it availible only under license?&nbsp; I suppose you&#039;ll just have to find another chem that isn&#039;t so restricted and work from there at that point....

				Totally missed this- <br />I was asked to come up with a synthesis for someone back in November, they linked me to some bullshit discussion on hipforums where the synth involved used sodium azide. After some lit searching and going back through some experiments I did in 2009, I pretty much came up with the same route, the only difference being I advised them to use Nickel Chloride (at a higher loading), 1.0M hypochlorite solution and potassium carbonate. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t realise a similar prep was already available, I charged them 15BTC for my efforts&nbsp; :-[

				You&#039;ve got 2 weak spots- the Hoffmann rearrangement and recovering your product. <br /><br />Knock up a 2.0M hypochlorite solution- 200g NaOH in 1250mL ice water. Set up a chlorine generator (conc HCl dripped onto KMnO4) and slowly bubble Cl2 gas through the NaOH solution until it weighs 140g more than when you started (put the beaker on scales). Adjust the pH with a little NaOH so it&#039;s about pH8. (Think the maths is right- will recheck tomorrow, ale-fog)<br /><br />Use this solution to run the Hoffmann in, start the reaction at 0ºC and allow it to warm to room temperature- expect a bit of an exotherm as you&#039;re using much stronger hypochlorite solution than just bleach. <br /><br />To recover more product, don&#039;t try to do a biphasic acidification of the toluene, you lose too much product. Extract a couple of times with toluene (once isn&#039;t enough), combine the extracts and dry with Magnesium Sulfate. Filter the MgSO4 off and chill the toluene. Set up an HCl generator (I love my gas generators&nbsp; ;D ) by dripping conc H2SO4 onto NaCl wetted with a little dilute HCl and gas the toluene solution. Filter off the MDA, chill and gas again (you tend to get a couple of crops of product when you gas amine solutions). The MDA should be a lot cleaner and you&#039;ll retrieve a lot more product.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve done some of these Beckmann type rearrangements (the aldoxime to amide step) with different metal salts- in my experience Nickel Acetate works better than NiCl2. Give it a go&nbsp; :D<br /><br />

				Yeah calcium hypochlorite should work, with the added advantage of being very OTC. <br />It&#039;ll be pretty exothermic so you may have to run a couple of experiments to determine what works best for you- In one, make a solution of the Ca(OCl)2 first and chill it. In the second, add the Ca(OCl)2 powder directly to the reaction mixture in portions. Have several kg of ice on hand in both cases&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Averagegatsby- that was the US vs Sicilliano case. Not sure if he was jailed, if I remember correctly a lot of the DEA&#039;s evidence was deemed inadmissible. Michael Siciliano doesn&#039;t show up on the bop.gov inmate locator.

				This is incredible thanks DopeBoy. If I remember correctly you&#039;re based in Canada, is it easy for someone in the US to acquire these chemicals? And how would you go about ordering/receiving them?

				This looks really interesting. Do you have any links to sources in chemistry literature or anything like that? <br /><br />Also, what alternative chems could one use? I know the solvents can be bought at Lowe&#039;s I think. Just wondering. <br /><br />I think the only chem that looks hard to get is the hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Whats the best way one would get this? <br /><br />Thanks<br />

				There are heaps of references for the Aldoxime to Amide rearrangement, here&#039;s a few<br /><br />http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01469a048<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20945850<br />http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adsc.201100650/full<br /><br />The other 2 reactions are trivial (the aldoxime formation and Hoffmann).<br /><br />If you can&#039;t find a place to buy hydroxylamine, you can make it by refluxing nitromethane, HCl and water. It&#039;s not a reaction I&#039;d be enthusiastic about running, not least as you&#039;d have to distill lots of nitromethane. There&#039;s a nice prep here:<br />http://www.sciencemadness.org/member_publications/energetic_glyoxime_and_diaminofurazan_derivatives.pdf<br /><br />but the yields are shitty. The second prep is better, I can&#039;t imagine a better way of alerting the authorities to your activities than heating a sealed tube containing a liter of nitromethane to near boiling&nbsp; :-\

And when US companies fail to meet the demand, Chinese and Indian companies will fill the void.<br /><br />Google these words - canada scientific glassware - and there should be at least a dozen good suppliers within the first 5 pages. Who cares if they&#039;re friendly or not... they either accept your money or not. And if not go to the next supplier lol. We&#039;re not begging them to take our money, they should be happy to get your business that&#039;s the way business is supposed to work. Yes many North American businesses have gotten spoiled and some of them will turn their noses up at us. It&#039;s to be expected. Just brush it off and remember that there&#039;s 80 million Chinee currently still making a dollar a day who will cater to our every need.

				So tonight I decided to try the aldehyde to Oxime again. I had a failed reaction that had been sitting in the freezer for about three weeks, Once I pulled it out I poured of the top liquid layer and kept the yellow frozen paste at the bottom, Im not a chemist but I think that the top is just methanol + carbonate which could dilute my second reaction, I then added appropriate amounts of Hydroxylamine hcl+water and methanol. I slowly rotated the glass jar it was in by hand and within 30 minutes, off white/yellow crystals started to appear at the bottom. I am guessing the reason it worked so well this time was less carbonate, I have read forum chatter that suggested to much sodium carbonate can stop it from solidifying.<br /><br />I&#039;ll up date later with more pics and info on how the other steps go.<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/P191012_00.56.jpg<br /><br />Sorry for the low quality pic, the white spots are groups of small crystals stuck together.

Extract a couple of times with toluene (once isn&#039;t enough), combine the extracts and dry with Magnesium Sulfate. Filter the MgSO4 off and chill the toluene. Set up an HCl generator (I love my gas generators&nbsp; ;D ) by dripping conc H2SO4 onto NaCl wetted with a little dilute HCl and gas the toluene solution.

The MDA should be a lot cleaner and you&#039;ll retrieve a lot more product.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve done some of these Beckmann type rearrangements (the aldoxime to amide step) with different metal salts- in my experience Nickel Acetate works better than NiCl2.

Maybe try dual solvent recrystallisation.<br /><br />Generating HCl gas using sulphuric acid in a flask and dripping 30% HCl solution through it connect drying tube with CaCl2 in there and gas the extracts directly.<br />

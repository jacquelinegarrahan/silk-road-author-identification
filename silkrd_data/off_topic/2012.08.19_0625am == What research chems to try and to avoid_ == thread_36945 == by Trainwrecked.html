				25I NBOME has become my favorite psychadelic by a long shot. I&#039;ve kinda lost interest in the rest.<br /><br />The other NBOMEs seem interesting too but I&#039;d start with 25I.<br /><br />Highly, highly reccommend at sun.set or sunrise. That or under a stary sky. Words dont do it justice. 1000 ug (1 mg) is perfect.<br /><br /><br />2C-B sounds fun and is next on my list.<br /><br /><br />Avoid MDPV. I tried it twice and flushed the entire gram. &quot;Hell&quot; would describe it well.<br /><br /><br />

				As a stimulants, I&#039;d suggest methiopropanamine and 5-it.<br /><br />Both are fine imo to IV, 5-it is somewhat stimulant+psych.<br /><br />

If im going to a free party then i can drop this at 8-9pm and still be going until the party ends at like 9am or whatever. If its something a bit earlier (eg club night finishing at 3am) then i drop earlier on like 5 or 6 pm, because it takes up to 3 hours to kick in (my current batch is probably more like 2) it&#039;s not really an issue. aMT duration i find is largely down to quantity consumed, did 40mg of a fresh batch and it lasted 16 hours, did 20mg of the same batch and i was fine to sleep after 10.

				It&#039;s hard to stick with real drugs when their availability is ridiculously low.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do MDMA anymore due to how addicted I was last year to it, Ketamine is almost impossible to find and any I&#039;ve ordered from SR has not been up to quality to what I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; No matter how much I did, it never gave me that spiritual experience I&#039;ve gotten before.&nbsp; LSD is impossible to find for a legit price.&nbsp; It&#039;s all overpriced bullshit on here.&nbsp;

				I know people have mixed feelings about methylone but I really enjoy it. After joining SR, I became a bit of an mdma connoisseur (not in a league near any of the pros here tho) and I make sure my friends know what they are getting and urge them to stay safe and responsible. I do have a shit ton of fun with all the great mdma SR has to offer, but that doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;m going to avoid lone all together. It&#039;s a different type of fun. Its extremely positive and straight foward and I like that. When I am not looking to have my mind melted and made to believe that the dj in front of me is baby jesus, then I use methylone. Drugs like mdma create their own time frame in a sense that you go into that &quot;trip&quot; and join a new world. Methylone doesn&#039;t quite take you there and fits into your shedule. Mdma is like a vacation to heaven and methylone is a really fucking solid night out after a long day of work. Just make sure you don&#039;t have to work early in the morning the next day&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah go with the caps they are 100 times easier to deal with and hit harder.&nbsp; Plus tyler is legit.<br /><br />Tabs you have to keep in your upper gums for a while and not swallow your spit. Only real plus to tabs is that they are easier to sell.

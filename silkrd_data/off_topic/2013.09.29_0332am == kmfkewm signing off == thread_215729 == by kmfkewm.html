				Well guys it has been a blast, really enjoyed my time here, but it is time for me to leave. I just wanted to let everybody know that I am not busted or anything, and to not worry when I stop coming around, which is going to be right now. I have some source code I talked about in another thread for a security project, I gave it to a few people who are going to keep working on the project but I am done with it and everything else related to the online scene. Astor and others a copy of the code will make its way to you guys eventually, sorry it took so long but some things came up. Was a pleasure posting here, and may the Agorist and Totalibertarian revolutions continue. In the end we will defeat the state, and I really hope that the agents and politicians who have tried to enslave us are lined up against walls and shot when that day comes. Keep up the good work DPR, you are doing a great thing. Peace !

				I am changing my password to something long and random that even I don&#039;t know. If anybody comes around here as kmfkewm in the future, it is not me. If I get in touch with any of you via some other means in the future, which may or may not happen, you will know it is me via shared knowledge between us or something. But I have no GPG key and don&#039;t plan to use this name anywhere else. So good bye everybody :).

				To be honest kmfkewn I was surprised that someone as security conscious as yourself has kept the same nym for so long. Most others who seem to have a similar knowledge base as you seem to have gone; not usually I believe altogether, just they have been sensible enough to realise that the more posts they make the more chance of creating a Venn diagram that zeros in on them. I assumed they are still here but under a different name.&nbsp; I have no idea if this will be the case with you. Whichever, I have always enjoyed your discussions and you have always made me think. The final thing you have made me think is should I do the same ? I have certainky let slip plenty personal info while&nbsp; here. The Buddhists teach that attachment is the cause of all suffering, should I be attached to an online identity?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I just find it hard to believe there&#039;s a board up in pig HQ with &#039;Hungry Ghost: what we know&#039;. I have never advocated mass killing of LE however....plus last night my freind who is still into local H scene showed me the texts he gets all day from local smack dealers advertising their wares openly. I assumed that these are burner phones operated seperately from the dealers, but no, it seems these are the phones the dealers can be reached on. In their pockets. All day. As they drive around selling heroin door to door. So I guess&nbsp; there are some lower hanging fruit than me!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway good luck Kmfkewn, and remember, if she/he claims to be 16/18( whatever age of consent is where you are) ASK FOR PROOF :-)<br />&nbsp;

				You were a pillar of our community, and although a mildly controversial figure for pointless principals, you will be missed.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always felt you were too educated for your opinions and principals, but you are entitled to cling to them as younger people cling to their blanket or teddy bear. Strong principals are ignorant youthful comforts, and you will abandon them in due time. You will be much happier with your life when you do.<br /><br /><br />It was an honor to have you among our ranks. Us 2011 users are now fewer in number, again. I&#039;m glad you had the opportunity to watch our little website grow into the thorn it is, on the asses of LE and their backers.<br /><br />

				good luck on whatever the future holds for you. its always sad to see some of the smarter people leave. you were smart enough to get ahead of whatever hate would come your way if you just left without a forewarning, im sure some crazy shit woulda came up if you had just fell off without letting the community know that you were moving on.

				Take care kmfkewm, <br /><br />Thanks for all the wisdom and knowledge you imparted to the community. Your knowledge and insight probably saved a whole host of people from &quot;imperial entanglements.&quot; <br /><br />It would be cool if you came back under a new name and dropped some science that we&#039;d need to know about. Hit and run posting would be good enough. Even if it&#039;s just to point us in the right direction or shake us out of our complacency. <br /><br />You will be missed.

He also has intelligence that the FBI has the IP addresses of many servers used by DPR and that this forum will soon be under the complete control of the feds.

				Now that we know there was an undercover agent could it be possible kmfkewm was either involved somehow? <br />According to an unverified source here it would appear he at least had some sort of inside knowledge? <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216860.msg1584213#msg1584213<br /><br />From what&nbsp; I gather he did have regular contact with DPR or at the very least they were &quot;known&quot; to one another.<br />He didn&#039;t vend and stated he does not use drugs but did offer money laundering advice (Great cover to potentially identify vendors)<br />He had vast knowledge of internet security on account of accessing underage pornography (Cover story, After all if DPR wanted to work with someone less risk in choosing someone who wont get busted on a drug possession charge) <br /><br /><br />At the very least he announced his departure only says before the bust and given the claims being made by a poster here it would appear he was at least &quot;Tipped off&quot; in some manner<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216860.msg1584213#msg1584213 <br /><br /><br /><br />On a different topic he did know his security and in one of his last posts about an article suggesting Feds were probing Silk Road suggested the IRC chat server as a particular weakness <br /><br />&quot;The primary new bit of information I see in this article is that they are focusing on the IRC server. &quot;<br /><br />Perhaps a MITM exploit&nbsp; is how they got DPR as I find it hard too hard to believe he didn&#039;t use PGP , Either that or they could somehow decrypt his PGP which would be a lot more worrying.<br /><br />From the original article<br /><br />&quot;Federal charges have yet to be brought against the site or its administrators, but another law enforcement source involved in the Silk Road probe said high-tech investigative methods used by the government are helping investigators build a case.<br /><br />Those methods include encryption-cracking technology and the exploitation of security weaknesses in some encrypted email and instant message software used by Silk Road customers, the source said&quot;<br /><br /><br />Maybe this is all conspiracy but even he would seem to admit the timing is suspect.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Does anyone else think that &quot;Project Black Flag&quot; (the &quot;new&quot; silk road being developed by &quot;Metta DPR&quot; is the project that kmfkewm is talking about? 2 days after SR being taken down it is already &quot;60% completed&quot;. hmm.

				If kmfkewm wasn&#039;t a UC and was who he said he was, he was probably working off charges from previous endeavors over here. (My opinion ofc, many disagree) He is also more then likely that guy, Brandon, DPR was talking about in that video, ordering the RC&#039;s from China. Either way, it&#039;d be worth finding out who that guy is and looking into his background as well.<br /><br />I honestly thought kmfkewm was a provocateur for the longest time, but who knows...<br /><br />LOL That ^ obviously makes no sense but I&#039;d still be interested to know who that Brandon guy is.

What&#039;s done went into motion long ago(late fall 2011) and can not be changed at this point, nor can what is going too happen in the next few weeks/months. My issue is with the statement that if kmf was working against the road that she would have used a different method than CP or as stated more popular. What &#039;terrorism&#039;?&nbsp; Come on!&nbsp; If you pay attention to the mass media that feeds the herds of sheep there is nothing more popular than the increasing amount of sex crimes involving children. It has been and is the #1 crime target on the internet, from US liked Countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />There are far more people that can and do turn the cheek to drug use that doesn&#039;t seem to hurt anyone else but the immediate people involved, but those same people would not be so inclined to ignore a child being taken advantage of. So if they really wanted to sway public opinion on the who with all are involved with the SR they would want this ugly angle exploited. Quite frankly I am surprised that something involving children was not the main reason for bringing the site down. But we&#039;ll have to wait and see as the drama unfolds and the media monsters are given directions to lead the public&#039;s outrage. <br /><br />Just for the record, I HATE RATS and never cared for the call for violence by kmf.<br /><br />Peace,<br />SP

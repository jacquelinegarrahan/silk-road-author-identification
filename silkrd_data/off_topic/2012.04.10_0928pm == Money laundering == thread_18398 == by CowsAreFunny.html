				Hi guys<br /><br />I was wondering, if you are a seller on The Silk Road, and you are earning a lot of bitcoins, what are some good methods to launder your money.<br /><br />Kind regards

				Cows,<br />&nbsp; what exactly are you trying to do?&nbsp; Buy stuff? Invest the money? Hold it as hard cash in your hands?<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Laundering&quot; is a very elastic word... the best way to launder it is to simply keep it out of your home tax jurisdiction. If you do that.. and do not access the money in your home tax jurisdiction then the need to &quot;launder&quot; it is minimal. It&#039;s just &quot;money away from home&quot; :D<br />&nbsp; If you want to access that money at home.. then you have to ask yourself what you want it for.. and how exactly do you want it (i.e. in what form) .

				You need to speak with someone that has knowledge about how to launder money. For the most part Silk Road is full of good advice from alot of great people with good intentions. However, I have come across many postings on SR forums about money laundering that were completely inaccurate.

Then open up a series of mailboxes in a major city near your locality.&nbsp; Each set of ID gets 2 mailboxes on opposite sides of town. Ideally you want a minimum of 5 IDs and 10 boxes.<br />&nbsp;Next.. you want to get REALLY familiar with this site&nbsp; http://coinabul.com/&nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp;You should start purchasing 1 coin, gold, 1 troy oz, per month, per mailbox. A one troy oz gold coin will set you back about 375 BTC. Take the remaining 250 BTC per month and trade them for Pecunix. Stash those codes away someplace safe.<br /><br />&nbsp;You get solid assets, easily swapped out at the local coin shops and coin shows, that you can claim were gifts from relatives and each item is a cool 1700 USD$ or so.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Personal preference I guess. I&#039;m not trying to build up a second business (even as a front) while developing the first one.<br /><br />If it were me I would leave the money offshore like I said (preferably in a anonymous Pecunix account.. which is obviously inflation and seizure proof). Failing that I would bring it onshore as precious metals like I said. <br /><br />&nbsp;The idea is to keep it simple, and keep it quiet. And preferably keep it outside your home tax jurisdiction (don&#039;t shit where you eat). <br /><br />&nbsp;If that&#039;s the Bourne Identity.. then call me Jason :D

				The whole idea of &quot;laundering&quot; your money is to have it taxed and legitimized by being so you can enjoy it freely and as for keeping it quiet, how else are you going to explain that extra money your bringing in if its not from a business ?<br /><br />Your talking more about tax evasion/minimization&nbsp; IMO<br /><br />

				Yeah exactly. Money laundering isn&#039;t just something you can do through silly schemes and hope for the best. It&#039;s an art you have to learn how to do properly and there is a huge difference between &quot;not paying tax&quot; and actually properly laundering money. They are actually two separate things altogether. I don&#039;t even explain how to do it properly without charging a fee.

				Just convert the cash into precious metals *whether digital or physical&quot; and sit on that shit. Sell off bits as you have need. Plenty of paranoid people who DON&#039;T do drugs who are goldbugs.. No taxes, no paperwork, no problem.&nbsp; Just make sure that initial transfer to you is obscured if it&#039;s physical (which honestly is probably overkill) and quietly move forward.<br /><br />&nbsp; As a no-brainer investment strategy for people whose skills are in making and selling dope, not being investment wizards it works damn well. It has worked well enough over the last 50 years that the goldbugs are WAY WAY ahead of the people who bought blue chips on the stock market.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now if you happen to be really skilled at laundering or investment arcana fine.. but most of us aren&#039;t, and probably aren&#039;t interested in spending the time to get to that level. We&#039;d rather get high, get others high, and play with our computers/girlfriends/boyfriends.<br /><br />&nbsp;Just flip your BTC to Pecunix or physical bullion a la coinabul . Make it your &quot;secret savings program&quot;. Live off your regular job. Simple. No papertrail to speak of. Very very quiet.

				as far as laundering it after it has been converted to cash, in the US, property tax lien sales are an effective way to launder it. it gequires three people. <br /><br />person A. - delinquent on their property taxes <br />person B - a friend willing to go to the auction with you and bid against you<br />person c. YOU<br /><br />go to auction. wait for low MIN bid property to get on the block. bid war your friend to the amount you are wanting to launder. win tax lien certificate. waIt two weeks, then pay the county clerk anonymously the amount due on the taxes plus the penalty fee (5-15% based on the state) YOU will recieve a check in the mail from your county government for the amount of the over-bid plus the interest you earned. tax sales are conducted mainly with cash auctions, and I have never been asked for any verification of funds, ID, etc. Now I haven&#039;t been laundering money in this way myself (I am just investing) but I have seen groups of guys (likely meth dealers) do exactly this at almost every auction I have been to.&nbsp; Government sanctioned money laundering!

				&nbsp;you ever wondered how all those $1/2euro/1 pound shops stay open selling all the same cheap crap,&nbsp; mostly cash turnover, non perishable stock.....<br /><br />&nbsp;Money laudering is going on all around you, in plain site in every&nbsp; town, on your high street,&nbsp; where its best hidden<br /><br />if its good enough for your local triad/Viet weed growers....

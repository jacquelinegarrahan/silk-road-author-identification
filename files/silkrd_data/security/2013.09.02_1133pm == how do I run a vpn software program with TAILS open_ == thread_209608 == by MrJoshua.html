				How do I connect to a VPN using TAILS? <br /><br />Normally in Windows, I open the OS and run the VPNs software that I previously downloaded.

Here it is straight out of the horse&#039;s mouth: <br /><br />Q: Is it possible to use Tails OS to connect to a VPN instead of Tor? There are times I need faster speeds. I understand it will lose some security.<br /><br />A: It&#039;s a very fundamental assumption of Tails to force all outgoing traffic to anonymity networks such as Tor. I don&#039;t think we want to provide ways of going around this since it would possibly compromise the security of all Tails users.<br /><br />If you want to use OpenVPN with a live distro and without Tor I bet you can use any Debian or Ubuntu derivative and install OpenVPN from it.<br />Comment by Tails — Fri 01 Jul 2011 11:17:36 AM CEST <br /><br />Source: https://tails.boum.org/forum/Possible_to_connect_to_VPN_instead_of_Tor__63__/<br /><br />Also see the discussions at: https://tails.boum.org/forum/Tor_with_VPN/#comment-ccfa0e5cd004824bda5e9096f92a1c26<br /><br />&nbsp;Tor with VPN<br /><br />Q: If I connect to a VPN via the host machine and run a Tails VM are there problems with this scenario? From my understanding the TOR entry and exit nodes will see the VPN IP?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also are the message contents still encrypted by TOR once they enter the VPN? That is while the VPN sees the IP of the TOR exit node, the contents are still TOR encrypted in the last <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hop to the TOR VM.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If I connect to a VPN via the host machine and run a Tails VM are there problems with this scenario?<br /><br />A: Not really, but this depends on what you mean with &quot;problems&quot;. Your VPN provider will learn your Tor entries (and hence your entry guards) and in general have the same power as your <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ISP normally has over you. Hence make sure you trust your VPN provider at least as much as your ISP.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; From my understanding the TOR entry and exit nodes will see the VPN IP?<br /><br />A: That is incorrect:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The VPN provider will know the IP addresses of your computer and your Tor entry node.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tor entry node will know the IP addresses of your VPN provider and your middle node.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tor middle node will know the IP addresses of your Tor entry and exit node.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tor exit node will know the IP addresses of your middle node and final destination.<br /><br />Hence no one but you know the entry and exit.<br /><br />Adding a VPN into the mix changes nothing from Tor&#039;s side; if the exit would be able to see your VPN provider&#039;s IP address it would be able to see you IP address when not using Tor, so there would be no anonymity. Luckily this is not the case.<br /><br />Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; Also are the message contents still encrypted by TOR once they enter the VPN?<br /><br />Yes. The VPN encryption is removed at the VPN provider, and the last (third) layer of Tor&#039;s encryption is removed at the Tor exit.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; That is while the VPN sees the IP of the TOR exit node, the contents are still TOR encrypted in the last hop to the TOR VM.<br /><br />Your VPN provider will know nothing about your Tor exit.<br />Comment by Tails — Thu 01 Mar 2012 10:45:42 AM CET<br />Comments on this page are closed.<br />Last edited Mon 15 Apr 2013 09:45:57 PM CEST<br /><br />Hope this answers your question. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0 <br />

				You can&#039;t install OpenVPN on Tails directly. I mean you can, but Tails uses a weird networking configuration that might now allow it to work, and you&#039;d have to reinstall it after each reboot. The best option is to install OpenVPN on a router that supports it (generally a router with DD-WRT and at least 32 MB of RAM), so your connection goes Tails -&gt; router -&gt; VPN -&gt; tor network.<br /><br />

				@MrJoshua<br />Yes. It will send the Tor traffic through the VPN. Doesn&#039;t matter if the VPN client runs on the router or computer. You may also want to slowly download torrents through the VPN (but not through Tor), to obfuscate&nbsp; even more what you&#039;re doing.

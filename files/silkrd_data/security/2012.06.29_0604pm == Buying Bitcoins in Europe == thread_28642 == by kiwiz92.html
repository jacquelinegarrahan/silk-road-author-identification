				Hi kiwiz92,<br /><br />In addition to vlad1m1r&#039;s services (who comes highly recommended by a large number of users here), you can also use www.canadianbitcoins.com (clearnet) to purchase Bitcoin using Western Union transfers. The price you pay is advertised in Canadian dollars.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				bitmarket.eu&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Might be hard to get verified if you havent used other BTC exchanges. But NO FEES.)<br /><br />bitstamp.net&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(havent used this one yet, but for some reason they use USD . Read good about this one though)<br /><br />bitcoin.de&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(disbursement limit sucks though you can only disburse 15 a day when you have less than 5 transactions.<br /><br />And than theres Intersango.

Only side note is that their bank is in Poland so by law their bank is allowed to take a small 1,5€ fee for a transaction.

For amounts up to £130 it&#039;s 12.5%, from £131 to £999 it&#039;s 10% and anything beyond that is 5% or lower&nbsp; - I also offer further discounts to repeat customers. <br /><br />I&#039;m happy to accept EUR/CAD/USD etc. but they&#039;re converted to GBP before being banked. Some of my customers have found it&#039;s less trouble just to send me their Euros and let me do the exchanging for them, some can get a better rate at home so buy some GBP and send that instead, it&#039;s all the same to me!<br /><br />CanadianBitcoins looks like a very professional setup as does the Mining Fund...!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />Not at all, just thought the user should know that people think quite highly of you here!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />I&#039;m happy enough myself with canadianbitcoins.com, I have a system worked out and it works for me but I may be interested in a few cash in the mail transactions myself in the future.

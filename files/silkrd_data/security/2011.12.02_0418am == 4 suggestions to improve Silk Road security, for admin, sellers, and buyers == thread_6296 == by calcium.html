				[Reposted from http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6235.msg54303#msg54303]<br /><br />This is going to get a little bit technical. I&#039;m a noob on the forum (and just executed my first successful purchase recently), but I do have significant expertise in the areas I&#039;m going to discuss.<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m not going to prove that statement, because I like keeping my anonymity, but other experts should be able to tell from what I say.<br /><br />tl;dr, here are four points of advice I STRONGLY suggest the community adopts:<br /><br />1. Sign each others&#039; keys once you have some proof that it belongs to the person it&#039;s claimed by, and do so at the appropriate level of validation. This helps build a &quot;Web of Trust&quot;, where while I may not know for sure that e.g. Holland is really PGP 4654CBBA, I *do* know reasonably that LexieSadie is PGP A7C82017. So if LexieSadie can prove to themselves that Holland&#039;s key is legit, there&#039;s a chain - I trust LexieSadie a little bit, she trusts Holland, therefore I can trust Holland.<br /><br />This goes for sellers, buyers, and Silk Road admin. SIGN EACH OTHERS&#039; KEYS — but ONLY when you have proof that they belong to the entity claimed. (E.g. proof for Silk Road admin could be that the key was the one used at the launch of site, has been consistently used in communication w/ sellers, etc.)<br /><br />When your key is signed by someone, get the revised public key from them, import it yourself, and post the updated version everywhere you normally have it, and say you&#039;ve done so. Then other people can import it, see the new signatures, and trust you more if they trust those signatures. It also makes merging multiple signatures easier.<br /><br />2. SELLERS: Include a small message printout in your envelopes, signed with the PGP key you posted on your seller account. It doesn&#039;t need to say anything substantive, but it MUST include the current date (e.g. &quot;Thanks! Shipped 1 Dec 2011&quot;).<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t give anything of value away if it&#039;s compromised by the feds (having a signature only tells them what ID it was signed with, not the full info of the key). But it DOES definitively prove to your recipient that the person who packed the envelope is the person who owns that key.<br /><br />If they get a slip with an implausibly old ship date, that&#039;s a red flag for compromise.<br /><br />3. SR Admin: There must be a PGP signed statement of the current legit URL, along with your PGP key with all current signatures, on SR&#039;s front page AT ALL TIMES, as well as on ALL former URLs. The key ID itself MUST NOT CHANGE, but more signatures = more trustworthy, if it&#039;s signed by someone that a user themselves has validated.<br /><br />Merely putting a message on there saying &quot;be sure you have the right URL&quot;, without any way to *prove* it&#039;s the right URL, is useless. The only proof is your PGP signature of a statement saying what the right URL is.<br /><br />4. NEVER EVER EVER EVER set a key&#039;s trust to &#039;ultimate&#039; unless it&#039;s YOURS. Set it to &#039;marginal&#039; if you have some evidence that they&#039;re who they say they are AND are trustworthy themselves; set it to &#039;full&#039; if you know for sure they&#039;re who they are and that you would trust keys that they sign. PGP has two separate things for this:<br /><br />TRUST (unknown, never, marginal, full, ultimate) dictates whether you trust OTHER keys that this key has signed. Hopefully you only do this if you&#039;ve personally validated it. (Remember that PGP trust propagates, so if you trust A and A trusts B [whom you&#039;ve never heard of], it&#039;ll figure out how much you should trust B)<br />SIGNATURES (0/uncategorized, 1/casual, 2/personal, 3/high) tell to others how much YOU have validated that the key belongs to who it says it belongs to. - see http://aperiodic.net/phil/pgp/policy.html

				Now for the details...<br /><br />Have you ever MET &quot;Silk Road&quot;? No. All you know is that you have *a* public key whose name part says &quot;Silk Road&quot;, which was used to sign the OP of this thread. Maybe, like me, you got that public key from earlier in the thread when some other anonymous user posted &quot;a&quot; public key.<br /><br />But unless you have some way to definitively prove that that key belongs to the entity you call &quot;Silk Road&quot;, it could just be anyone.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a demonstration:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />mQENBE7XgZMBCADPcZOWleapwp5JX+CiDR5+1cWq5Xf/RgwBH7tU2jjVkjpiiXCs<br />nYcoeqUJ5IWfrBf+U6XKXRyA9jmHxmz/FoZq+yTIXxOq/09RvFBMpyBqiZYZ4CFb<br />vq6YCis9izml0tW7JRrlevCevvGJnP++YTw/tNh1sw043W48fA05ubNQO6m8Ei+I<br />Dh7wLiGPKQ8i/lVwThjkEyPdkODrlp94hm9OS6xqvS89Geirm+f4b33lTMNmux9X<br />PFSvekmV2y/ysRd1kOXwN647iyTAX1V5SG5fEPaAOl324etDaNI+uM76xcFAxTy1<br />7DXhhjHAi79Ekz9FtTITg3gcmsKwzMOxswiFABEBAAG0JFNpbGsgUm9hZCA8c3Rh<br />ZmZAc2lsa3JvYWRtYXJrZXQub3JnPokBOAQTAQIAIgUCTteBkwIbLwYLCQgHAwIG<br />FQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQRmK/fh2St5aO0wf/RG1GGDwv1PzbKTQT03O1<br />Wz4cZOZE4llXrL99Bj8EcrrsrakY/Djks+IsMin1YW1S1ggPwUy7WN0zZU2NkVoE<br />Lwm4NcSmn2T/vbo+qsp/frsQ4G6EyzNnUsTerWsv/yaAje05+0Y9etvRIBi2Dve1<br />IKTac0v2nAqQyicrZCLBFx+FrPUJuK9lbKyTqjEnSpqM8qVSVGbQAbnbzpg3AGXi<br />11SmZup5L0uFiGp1Hq8EEJxIJAyj5mMbsVpEhaimPR9qeMui6vXxsiahF8rKWehf<br />8/U909cqNylfq2uA8tK9MWMQsIZAbvCz+yIcjetmWXBZHIRjJGioEO59Sl0ujgU1<br />v7kBDQRO14GTAQgAwsYFQAtmPWAs3+8wOFeTWg6YUycniOK1Htdj18rKvTD7+1A9<br />XiZTElsvITUbPENIwSam+VAMruM1TOUFd1MsFNrmycfmxOXA271o3eqW3a2J1Irl<br />3zH78sE1UV5v9oY0snOSSscHa70B2AB93XYZu6rthR1K67lRJqISrGKQQaPYm+Zl<br />wZFTwp2VANn/h/8mZszhP5t72e6GnmyG9ULhjtd/zKKqljkKMzJqE8x/LiX1RYfn<br />NrfsAqJJ+bMwUgHPbeADRs17KRxilP2NF9v69H0GcjBre8bxVDp1qsFoTRUHi5cl<br />qRNWusApR4kazq4D3XGwIfotvsDnOytQeogdKwARAQABiQI+BBgBAgAJBQJO14GT<br />AhsuASkJEEZiv34dkreWwF0gBBkBAgAGBQJO14GTAAoJEI/OqxbZnNhTDKcIALlf<br />2lqJWEWRKHg4lJqKZlnnRaIzjlLASnjKJh/CCGamZU/mnumHOgvq2KphonTvq2Pa<br />WkLiELCoRVyd9HTQpyTtVkKHf6Ryp5Yg8jLCbAX+/EfM486O8Y0jkgQCS9G1Dv2d<br />t13MgnN4qlDaJyLutEDcLXZEXUFRZI4X29GFQo9CWLd/0LZhamycY7eotLhTXIzU<br />urOUf2RbhP8dOhy+2k2OI5rceH6FqT+A1GpCmygoFHbxeKNNumIdE7wK6lGfssOj<br />ZlmqdZGF41QR6ere0wGdH/MLSsZHekuGAWm/6pUF12vYw8SjKqz+gkc4FXGmV+Dp<br />3UDm2f1R4NGIMnoBqTaq5wf7ByOqRmxbXn2Phr3jvuOb3jH0HAE6zNTifSh17WYW<br />EZdPiKJkw+ZG0+FpZyPK2x1fXH6jjgglq2Ht4Vo8Xw73PKhvbKU6RNe0aCTkn19H<br />QFB/j/G0MJ4gCpLpPQ8XWeINC2LfA+kVYAqcdmoDrlw4bzbvPRFR5zp71V/9iSBI<br />klAidBeEuRxAs3VUzm1gUVnZRykr92PCxnACWH1z/8hOTg0P3N7INO21fsOcxAr3<br />TioFdjcC/rDTFMWphrnIclj1b0WDPEdksTWs+9VNuWlFMK1Pf6NUVyT41235+4mN<br />/mJDd/ynvxqgtIw9Un0jD57q2L+FAbjP8skxMzOPxBPYeg==<br />=/fjb<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />lol silk road moved to http://phish.u.com.

A key is just a key. You have to have some other means of proving whom it belongs to. (Note that I didn&#039;t bother faking the creation date on that key, or any of a number of other things that I could have done to very closely mimic key ID # 67B7FA25, but I&#039;m lazy. Trust me, I could do it. The only thing I can&#039;t do is make a new key with the exact same ID and fingerprint, or replicate others&#039; signatures.)<br /><br /><br />I would suggest a few potential remedies:<br /><br />1. Sellers: if you have had previous (long-term) GPG exchange with &quot;the real Silk Road&quot;, such that you&#039;re 100% convinced the owner of that key is the admin of ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion, validate that key and SIGN IT with the key you use for customers.<br /><br />Likewise, Silk Road, sign the keys of registered sellers you know are legit.<br /><br />This way, noobs like me who only know a couple sellers&#039; GPG keys, and know them as legit because we actually got our shit IRL, but weren&#039;t around in the early days to get SR&#039;s pubkey from a legit source (sorry, this isn&#039;t a legit source), can then in turn trust that key.<br /><br />Since we don&#039;t want to expose these keys to public key servers, the exchange has to happen manually.<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s an example.<br /><br />This is LexieSadie&#039;s PGP key as published on her last listings:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />mQENBE5u9HcBCADU/e5i+tdp8iohkmb9WSc41A2tR5sE4RwO7gMi3J0oEulzyojB<br />4ClJV9/N/ob8j/DhNw77b1iSIl2QrRvrgS2MrTPBB58ocFfp1tezgFaJ1FLLRAYY<br />C3Xra4h/XNLYdQD4wbprUPxZNjS323Rw4os3ZNc4EI+CFDAYnbZcKOGh2CISzIq2<br />IsWZf7Bdwf7dPGYDrVsGu5hjm6EoLzCtMBj/0/OWOb9XzoKq9JJXOCK/VG0Z/fwF<br />UB8SqRc9avGm7RdKMqM+T9iqyIhxCmtBcbGirpYtfjr8hpMMauJllheqHlHjSWr8<br />5wxdZIZQYi/SP5XVl68G2tRnctM9aeVdiEn1ABEBAAG0GUxleGlTYWRpZSA8ZmFr<br />ZUBmYWtlLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAk5u9HcCGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMB<br />Ah4BAheAAAoJEOftwSKnyCAXEukH/Rwe4ESfRI7awzOkrgIMNVJoueOprhzuek8I<br />7YxaXPm4ChkVE/wY7yoqUFk6fkZehPyUAcILQmwfSpdwiApSgkUfH9FahdOHoK0U<br />aSM2xsUuiifAJJN0nin/ftOjZdtugRmfks/hSa+QUbwsGDVPFJRXMRQUyVTeYxam<br />YCAHg8gNuHUnCEAfgine4ZiO0un5aAOkxExmQKe5uLzAQazC7WH5/odKmr+d7IM9<br />wSEKnFZQmgLcl9URfhlkWWFFLNOV55aOwlwtl8JDrkQjujn6rHH5+Zisu70Wg6hH<br />8zsNt9pPYZXpYP2/ZSEPLwV4chI0rfavnidQEIr9u//1Tn/8NgK5AQ0ETm70dwEI<br />AN2AGonXB+y4lmedPaTNoYHtDTTgJfl9zVaYrUH5+fWMoOcKiV4tbgK9RYgKClQX<br />ioLN9gIEhpmSPR9LIgELfIWbPO9sM1tvvcEMOtGBjv4Ndlh3m7c1RX6nbiYLjGss<br />1AR7l0kp40X0rrgplTOQ8q3AhsYd2LBigueiWiYhdFjrjdc0K7r0hUJvcEAWom3L<br />TgxJna7Uq0KnxoSTQEH8jmsyqlccKaNIfJjbNgJicbDg8uA8qlS8xTql7yjlA777<br />YPzH/GeqQ9wl+nY65pinq2TqK4ZEynS9bPMSXlOSw5JGZQws+pd4PsYEk6ix/ONM<br />j5AYpWlq/Q/+CR+pJaXPGycAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUCTm70dwIbDAAKCRDn7cEi<br />p8ggF2CLCACS0JE12FWRVfRXq4ii1SRdea5nBeUJZrWK55F5/pFEBPUoWczZa/ra<br />YfT7vQXimnO7YG2C1QxzwB5wB2kur7teMvQo/D2gzRf3G/bByAqMU2ClKrEYBAj+<br />WF6sWtULbRzb7sECKWs1UWgX019PtE/bdzsABWAnxEC1wX+czMAAl3JrI3Rd/hTh<br />1+mVVn18gDnt2mcOMBpHHTKZE2gXy0vzIo8iPpwlrIh05CvMgSCoE33MdbG33RU8<br />+c7zOw3lrdTJ8So/2O36+0vSypbCzuJVAa2DpDkrRoiok8QQx8963durh51ibtT4<br />ABbV3I/AtoBqLi+89AkoeI0XtMM09cY1<br />=nQB4<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve had a successful transaction with LexieSadie, encrypted to that, so I have *weak* confirmation that the above key represents the actual human who handled my weed so brilliantly.<br /><br />Why &quot;weak&quot;? Simple: someone else could run a phishing site, replace all PGP keys with fake ones (like I faked SR above), and then just run a silent MITM attack where they pass any messages back and forth.<br /><br />But hey, it&#039;s something. Since &quot;LexieSadie&quot; isn&#039;t a human per se, it&#039;s a pseudonym that a human (or group) uses to do business, there&#039;s only so much you can do to validate that.<br /><br />So, I went into GPG Keychain Access, and signed her key with that of the buyer account I used with LexieSadie. I set the verification level to &#039;casual&#039;, given the above.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the revised key:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />mQENBE5u9HcBCADU/e5i+tdp8iohkmb9WSc41A2tR5sE4RwO7gMi3J0oEulzyojB<br />4ClJV9/N/ob8j/DhNw77b1iSIl2QrRvrgS2MrTPBB58ocFfp1tezgFaJ1FLLRAYY<br />C3Xra4h/XNLYdQD4wbprUPxZNjS323Rw4os3ZNc4EI+CFDAYnbZcKOGh2CISzIq2<br />IsWZf7Bdwf7dPGYDrVsGu5hjm6EoLzCtMBj/0/OWOb9XzoKq9JJXOCK/VG0Z/fwF<br />UB8SqRc9avGm7RdKMqM+T9iqyIhxCmtBcbGirpYtfjr8hpMMauJllheqHlHjSWr8<br />5wxdZIZQYi/SP5XVl68G2tRnctM9aeVdiEn1ABEBAAG0GUxleGlTYWRpZSA8ZmFr<br />ZUBmYWtlLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAk5u9HcCGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMB<br />Ah4BAheAAAoJEOftwSKnyCAXEukH/Rwe4ESfRI7awzOkrgIMNVJoueOprhzuek8I<br />7YxaXPm4ChkVE/wY7yoqUFk6fkZehPyUAcILQmwfSpdwiApSgkUfH9FahdOHoK0U<br />aSM2xsUuiifAJJN0nin/ftOjZdtugRmfks/hSa+QUbwsGDVPFJRXMRQUyVTeYxam<br />YCAHg8gNuHUnCEAfgine4ZiO0un5aAOkxExmQKe5uLzAQazC7WH5/odKmr+d7IM9<br />wSEKnFZQmgLcl9URfhlkWWFFLNOV55aOwlwtl8JDrkQjujn6rHH5+Zisu70Wg6hH<br />8zsNt9pPYZXpYP2/ZSEPLwV4chI0rfavnidQEIr9u//1Tn/8NgKJAhwEEgECAAYF<br />Ak7XhWAACgkQBXxJQf+3Q3dvmw//d5dGDojxkgG+RARncr02BNUBNKs+JiOg1syq<br />tXSBnpPuNVvGtJVfX9A1PErpHLUTL58mPDXW27gqvZ4/QW2g+quNqlD/jwYdocoo<br />Eyk7FqIqyf32kSaSCKnUrSbnFzYQrYsZL9gZyBdkcOULroFkN7b2Mv+MXm2/I7yi<br />uBsw8Usf7Z2H0WropX5fY/BCrPAGZU0R+m/kJJFxkG2DKfXoE5xRPBzV9Tzm/xgz<br />avvD7RJ6PPpBKgy1G9nQa6Brhs0KGb+r1unXexz5Fo85srlJX9A0eCqqiIFfiwtK<br />P8GBjFqjovqb3E6y7fLtyfMlP3dwQ+GT2GZ6lHMeKX32Xt0XmGO7z/JCjQI325wt<br />EpN9naSmJw4JbTrtM6t8oaru0/bIOhH5tgm26VZIGulefT4KSayumtDfVUu2Ffri<br />+31CpLfAZ46yL0rINn2K9NonosBrGqiPzxy/BuiwOrGYsU77hsw8ju2T/cHoFXnX<br />uKqhSXst894l4b3q6ydEXnJXWl7vqMkiQvRDdh/Dq2o/0QIQNoOACAp8WEwo1axo<br />OYRBFEDybW9LjQSXHc/j2GrjWSeVcrA2TDmsJ5JR1ZAd4i11iLB53bqGL864zeii<br />QitLK1H6TSsgcyBTTPP0QHRhM7FFg8tn5PkFJJv9D3bhH88OiX2qXAGb4WsaMflK<br />iDNZ0L+5AQ0ETm70dwEIAN2AGonXB+y4lmedPaTNoYHtDTTgJfl9zVaYrUH5+fWM<br />oOcKiV4tbgK9RYgKClQXioLN9gIEhpmSPR9LIgELfIWbPO9sM1tvvcEMOtGBjv4N<br />dlh3m7c1RX6nbiYLjGss1AR7l0kp40X0rrgplTOQ8q3AhsYd2LBigueiWiYhdFjr<br />jdc0K7r0hUJvcEAWom3LTgxJna7Uq0KnxoSTQEH8jmsyqlccKaNIfJjbNgJicbDg<br />8uA8qlS8xTql7yjlA777YPzH/GeqQ9wl+nY65pinq2TqK4ZEynS9bPMSXlOSw5JG<br />ZQws+pd4PsYEk6ix/ONMj5AYpWlq/Q/+CR+pJaXPGycAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUC<br />Tm70dwIbDAAKCRDn7cEip8ggF2CLCACS0JE12FWRVfRXq4ii1SRdea5nBeUJZrWK<br />55F5/pFEBPUoWczZa/raYfT7vQXimnO7YG2C1QxzwB5wB2kur7teMvQo/D2gzRf3<br />G/bByAqMU2ClKrEYBAj+WF6sWtULbRzb7sECKWs1UWgX019PtE/bdzsABWAnxEC1<br />wX+czMAAl3JrI3Rd/hTh1+mVVn18gDnt2mcOMBpHHTKZE2gXy0vzIo8iPpwlrIh0<br />5CvMgSCoE33MdbG33RU8+c7zOw3lrdTJ8So/2O36+0vSypbCzuJVAa2DpDkrRoio<br />k8QQx8963durh51ibtT4ABbV3I/AtoBqLi+89AkoeI0XtMM09cY1<br />=ex2Z<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Try importing it. You&#039;ll see that it is indeed the same key as the previous one, it just has a new signature for the primary UserID.<br /><br />LexieSadie could also sign *my* public key as someone she has successfully completed as a transaction with. I could then use that revised public key in new communications with sellers, who&#039;d see definitive proof that the person they know as LexieSadie has some trust in me, and use that as part of their decisionmaking for whether to trust me as a buyer.<br /><br />I should underscore here that you should NOT &quot;early sign&quot; a key. You should only do it when you have some level of proof that the person is who they say they are.<br /><br /><br />2. So, what&#039;s the maximum amount of proof that a given PGP key is &quot;real&quot;? This is a question of what the likely attack scenarios are. Let&#039;s go through them.<br /><br /><br />SR Admin:<br /><br />a) Site has an SQL injection exploit or similar vulnerability that allowed an attacker to completely dump its database, allowing them to put up a new hidden service (say, silkroadvb5piz3r.onion) with all that info intact.<br /><br />Limitation: they would not have access to SR&#039;s private PGP keys, unless they&#039;re a total idiot and storing them on the server rather than somewhere independent and safe.<br /><br />b) Site has a MITM attack, aka the usual phishing method. Attacker puts up a new hidden service (say, silkroadtherealthign.onion). Since they don&#039;t have the DB, what they do is just proxy all requests to the real site. This adds a delay, but since we&#039;re dealing with Tor, delays are not suspicious. The phisher&#039;s site could then steal all transparent info (eg passwords) and all database info (by scraping what users see).<br /><br />Limitations: same as above, plus the added delay.<br /><br />c) SR has been compromised IRL by the police, who have forced them to hand over their PGP private keys and passwords, database, hidden service ID/secret keys, etc, in return for more lenient sentencing and the ability to get lots of info about drug smugglers (aka all you lovely sellers). They continue operating the site exactly as usual. They can sign with SR&#039;s PGP key and do everything else they did.<br /><br />Limitations: unless they have SR&#039;s active cooperation, they might make mistakes replicating their writing style. Also, if there were any out-of-band secrets passed that they *didn&#039;t* manage to capture (ie they weren&#039;t on whatever machines they compromised, and SR the human didn&#039;t blab about them), then they wouldn&#039;t know those secrets.<br /><br /><br />Ways to prove the PGP is legit against a &amp; b: post a signed message on the front page of every legit SR URL ever (current and previous), saying &quot;The correct SR URL is blahblahblah.onion&quot;. Also list SR&#039;s public key with all current signatures. The key will change regularly as new signatures are added, but its ID, fingerprint, etc core properties will not change.<br /><br />Ways to protect against c: If compromise is suspected, someone who has an out-of-band secret (eg communicated via some other Tor service the feds didn&#039;t know about and/or weren&#039;t able to get records of) can challenge the SR admin to decrypt a PGP message signed with that as a symmetric key.<br /><br />For example, suppose SR and I had chatted on another Tor service. They validated with the same PGP key as now, and said eg &quot;My granduncle has a mole on his left eyelid.&quot; I note down this information privately and date it.<br /><br />Now suppose sometime later, I suspect SR has been fully compromised and is now actually the feds. The feds don&#039;t know this secret, since it wasn&#039;t in any of the logs they got, and SR didn&#039;t mention it to them.<br /><br />What I can do is post the following challenge publicly:<br /><br />&quot;If you are the real SR: remember the conversation we had? Decrypt this message using the key &quot;[relative]-[distinguishing mark]-[location]&quot;, no spaces.&quot; (I.e. &quot;granduncle-mole-lefteyelid&quot;)<br /><br />I create a signed message like so (gpg -a --clearsign -s -u FFB74377):<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Whoever decrypted this was Silk Road as of 2010-4-23. <br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJO1468AAoJEDuHYd3NEX2Ndt0P/j2uRzBJsl6nzCR1iOp3dcP7<br />AHqpGfyARTdG2DPQ80zWxCI7NDH+rTFO2mBn7Mkg0iuewBv0nJVHNLVAKk6L8tHX<br />8J0xUXm6zB9GdM175euPWBsn3Sv8CgBVf3hfOo9ZWLblwJa/a+Ll6/hB+Ft11lqu<br />JolFYcdOiQZwHuMyruMLDWBkrgiibxDAPUJC2AyIs9dBFJHZPVm/GiorNLIFQXHV<br />mQqg+kxdrZfhqnfdEUTdwTQ87dUQI+hA+ozKaPoVmIUKx8/j3TXlsPt8bEV783aA<br />rFJUkFlZZK2AZoiFDgMCOHODOiEu/AQKa3kfJg1AbcMPuW/UDABXdV/GBBdvVryf<br />yhlCx6SWuTGBWLdDLOvZHrjqnn54BuTZ71jnq0ErqdLoej6K/GomLnmwzKqXMVvF<br />SsUz4/HVIPbKzLh4iqFX9Ql5ZQj1XrFo8kjHV8HDoN1AeHx7CmUwNWOGLN4fSAr/<br />xhvwSUhwX9B8jSCNQsIQ5CjgY2zgiIvwdJn6ZWHkOxr0fIciwLcrpZWBebFSmWKS<br />wP9fqsF7suGHqDX+GVaDZUspfBE/IBxVGEqwyDq/W8OP/VgQw0GMBL0k4DOO3Mvu<br />AmATrIKzHK7L0aXw54n7C3+kbzC8gVEc9hxOb65cE0a+pXC+tLywUdpCNMu5em6r<br />vHuMC6yHRA+qWtE3r0FT<br />=uWwr<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />This message itself can be proven legit by anyone who trusts key FFB74377.<br /><br />I don&#039;t post *that* message, of course.

Since the passphrase is based (hopefully) on a secret that only I and SR share, that proves that they are in fact SR (as of the date I received the secret). They can prove this easily by decrypting it and posting the previous, clearsigned statement. Try it for yourself.<br /><br /><br />Sellers:<br /><br />a) Cops or phishers are performing a MITM attack. They post their own PGP key, pretending it&#039;s the seller&#039;s. When the buyer sends them their info, they decrypt it and send it to the real seller (with a new key pretending to be the buyer, just like mine above pretending to be SR), and vice versa. In other words, they just MITM the PGP conversation.<br /><br />Limitation: they don&#039;t actually have the seller nailed IRL; they only have either compromised their SR account or the SR site itself. So they can&#039;t control what the seller does IRL.<br /><br />b) Cops have completely compromised the seller IRL. They continue operating their business as usual to get more info before prosecutions. They have the seller&#039;s real PGP key and secret, samples of their packaging, everything.<br /><br />Limitations: they may not have access to the seller&#039;s supply chain (unless the seller ratted &#039;em out), so once they run out of the seller&#039;s stockpile, they&#039;ll have to start using product they get from elsewhere, and buyers might notice this. They might not replicate the seller&#039;s communication style well (this is more subjective). And the same thing as above about secrets.<br /><br /><br />There&#039;s an easy, definitive defense against (a): the seller includes a small message printout in their package, signed with the PGP key you posted on their seller account. It doesn&#039;t need to say anything substantive, but it MUST include the current date (e.g. &quot;Thanks! Shipped 1 Dec 2011&quot;). This proves that the person who packed the product (who is the &quot;real&quot; seller when it comes down to it) owns the PGP key that was published.<br /><br />If they get a slip with an implausibly old ship date, that&#039;s a red flag for compromise.<br /><br />*Weak* (non-definitive) proof that the seller owns the PGP key is receiving product without that slip. This only proves that the message encoded to that PGP key got to the seller and was acted on — it doesn&#039;t rule out a MITM attack like in (a).<br /><br />(b) can only be defended against by being (subjectively) suspicious of a change in product or communication style, or using the shared-secret method above.<br /><br /><br />Buyers:<br /><br />This one is hard, in that the only thing you get from buyers is payment. You have no way to prove that they&#039;re a real buyer and not a cop, that they actually received the envelope you sent (vs it going to some police warehouse and the buyer pretending it&#039;s all good), etc.<br /><br />There are however a couple methods.<br /><br />a) Successfully receiving payment from a buyer proves only that they are able to pay. This is a weak proof of their identity, but it&#039;s at least something.<br /><br />b) Sellers can include a UNIQUE serial number slip on the inside of each package. Buyer then sends you signed a message saying &quot;I received a package with serial number 12381238&quot;. This proves at least that they have some control over the receipt of the package, and that the package was not intercepted en route by the postal inspectors and then sent on its way. It doesn&#039;t prove that the buyer themselves isn&#039;t a cop, of course.<br /><br />To be really secure, this requires using packaging that&#039;s truly tamper-evident AND hard for the PIs to duplicate. That&#039;s relatively difficult; you have to have some source of bags or stickers that the PIs don&#039;t.<br /><br />This is a moderate proof of their identity.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how to authenticate the identity of a buyer any better than that.<br /><br /><br />So there you go: an expert&#039;s advice for how to really prove you&#039;re you when we&#039;re all anonymous.<br /><br />Do with it what you will.

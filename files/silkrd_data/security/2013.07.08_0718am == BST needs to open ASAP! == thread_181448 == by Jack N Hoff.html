				Anyone know of any alternatives for small amounts until BST reopens? I think it has to do with the BTC value drop, but I am not sure. I never saw the message the guy above me did. Hopefully it gets resolved soon!

				they just updated their .onion site. Still no hope for today, fuck. <br /><br /><br />&quot;We are currently closed for new trades.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We are sorry. Our challenges persist—we don&#039;t have the inventory to do any trades today. We&#039;re just not sure when we&#039;ll have inventory, so please make other plans if you need coins now. We&#039;re not going away though, so we will return in a day or two when things clear up. As always, thanks for your continued support. &quot;

				LocalBitcoins.com is a very good option. It took a while for me to get the hang of it, as with most things. (AADHD-Pi) <br /><br />Since most of you probably are comfortable with BoA deposits, like BST does. You can usually find at least one vendor doing BoA deposits, as well as Wells Fargo, and Citibank. <br /><br />I paid $9 over the going rate per coin, but it was worth it to me. You may find better deals. Also there&#039;s the &#039;meet in person&#039; option. <br /><br />*Hint - if you don&#039;t see any BoA &#039;s or other banks you may want on that first list that goes by your zip code, click the link under the last listing that says, &quot;Show All In USD&quot;&nbsp; and then you&#039;ll get a much longer list. It doesn&#039;t matter what zip code when you think about it, because you&#039;re doing a bank deposit. <br /><br />They have ratings next to sellers just like on SR+Ebay. - It&#039;s actually a very good site. - No need for BST anymore. Not for me anyway. <br /><br />Also wasn&#039;t BST always closed on Mondays? Either way. LocalBitcoins is it for me. You can message back and forth with the seller to clarify any special requests they might have. - Though the one I found was easier than any other btc purchase I&#039;ve made, and I&#039;ve been buying on the road since April 2012.<br /><br />Good Luck all. - Hope this helps

				I suppose for the larger volume buyers, the costs do add up,&nbsp; but for me to buy 200.00 worth of ฿TC&#039;s and pay just under $20 wasn&#039;t that much unlike BitInstant back in the good ol days.&nbsp; <br /><br />LocalBitcoins will probably get shut down soon too, but for now? I don&#039;t see any better ideas. <br /><br />Within minutes of leaving the bank counter I got a text confirming the arrival of ฿TC in my wallet. (yes it&#039;s a throw away phone)<br /><br />Let&#039;s hope this current squeeze by the man, brings about more creative and competitive exchanges. <br /><br />I would think locating the servers in the Grand Cayman Islands wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea. ;) - That&#039;s where all the leaders stealing our money have been keeping theirs! <br /><br />Though I wouldn&#039;t know, I&#039;m a PUA guy here. (Personal Usage Amounts) - not sure if that acronym exists already :P<br /><br />Chip<br />

				I, for one, dont want to use LocalBTC. I love BST and am really crossing my fingers but their tor website has said since last week they were going to be stocked Monday (today) then they changed their message (the blue paragraph) to give an unspecific date when they are getting more BTC.<br /><br />I cant believe bitinstant is closed as well. I have NO WAY to buy BTC and it is hurting me. <br /><br />All the exchanges shutting down lately has me worried, and thinking it is part of something big and not merely coincidental. <br />For the time being i am just going to sit on my cash and cross my fingers for BST to get back up and running.<br /><br />IF this is going to last a long time or BST and bitinstant go out of business like bitfloor and liberty reserve did then ill have to look into other options for getting my BTC/drugs.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s a little bit of a trick to localbitcoins. You have to watch for the bank transfer guys with lower prices to pop up and be prepared to buy maybe 50 bucks worth of coin. They tend to pop up and sell out within a matter of an hour or two. I had a ton of success last week with it but this week I haven&#039;t seen any of my go to guys. I finally got my Dwolla account set up as that seems like a popular option on there. I am not as worried about anonymity though as I buy bitcoins to trade on the exchanges. Some eventually end up here after many transfers and a tumbler so good luck tracing them.

				im almost positive that the problem bluesky is having is mt gox used to credit acts as soon as they were notified of an impending transfer but they recently changed there policy and are now waiting for the money to actually show up in the mt gox acts before it gets credited which can take several days. this has happened to a few people in just the last week. so with that in mind bitcoin dealers will probably be runnung out of bitcoins more often as they wait for tranfers to go thru where in the past they were almost instant.

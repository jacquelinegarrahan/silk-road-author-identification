				I originally postet this report at the SciBay Forum.<br /><br />Date of experience: 10/05/2012<br />Age: 20<br />Sex: male<br />Weight: 81kg<br />Prescription medicine: none<br />Dietary habits: I eat when I&#039;m hungry till I&#039;m full :)<br />Chronic illnesses: Attention Deficit Disorder<br />Other notes: none<br />Substance(s) and dosages (if known), method and time frame of administration if multiple:<br />2C-P, ~3-4mg, intranasal, T+0h<br /><br />Report:<br />Because my scale isn&#039;t very accurate at low quantities, I weighed out a larger amount. I weighed it multiple times and I got consistent readings of 10-11mg. Then I divided it in three equal piles and snorted one of them. I have read about 2C-P giving people unbearable nasal burning sensations but I found it to be only slightly more painful than snorting a large dose of Methylone or 4-MEC.<br /><br />T+0:10h<br />Damn, this is coming on fast! If taken orally, it takes one full hour to feel the first effects of 2C-P but after only 10 minutes of snorting it I&#039;m already half-way where I want to get. I feel slightly nauseous.<br /><br />T+0:20h<br />Unfortunately I have to throw up. Fortunately I haven&#039;t eaten anything today. The effects are already stronger than I thought they would get. That&#039;s not a bad thing though. No anxiety whatsoever.<br /><br />T+0:30h<br />I throw up a second and last time. The effects are still intensifying. I&#039;m watching stupid shit on the internet until I peak.<br /><br />T+0:45h<br />The effects are not getting any more intense. Everything I see is moving/morphing/shifting in fantastic ways. I see patterns on plain-colored surfaces. For example, I&#039;m reading YouTube comments and the white background behind the text turns into a wall with graffiti of awesome detail.<br /><br />T+0:55h<br />I decide to take my phone and my good headphones (Creative SoundBlaster Tactic3D Sigma), put on some psychedelic music and let my thoughts drift while laying on my bed in a dark room. I choose the Album &quot;Blue Moon Station&quot; by Solar Fields (amazing music and artist!!!).<br />Despite the stimulating effects of 2C-P I can enter a hypnagogic/sleep paralysis kinda state rather easily (I&#039;m a proud lucid dreamer :D). The music and my thoughts create extremely plastic and vivid imagery and scenery. I won&#039;t even try to explain that. People who have had full-blown psychedelic experiences will know what I&#039;m talking about though.<br /><br />T+2:15h<br />The music is coming to an end and I&#039;m coming back from a fantastic journey through my mind. I&#039;m still trippin&#039; ballz but not as intensely as before. I continue to enjoy the stimulating and sensory-enhancing effects of 2C-P. The weather is beautiful (25°C where I live) so I decide to go in the garden and let my thoughts drift some more.<br /><br />T+5:20h<br />I decide to write this report. I&#039;m still feeling the effects of 2C-P quite clearly but nowhere near as intensely as before.<br /><br /><br />This is my first experience report. Please give feedback on what I did right and wrong :)

				Haven&#039;t tried snorting 2C-P, but I tried vaping it, and it seems like a waste of time (compared to oral administration). When smoking I got short rushes (10mins.) with nice visuals, after that no visuals, only slight stimulation, barely noticeable. Vaporized dosage - ~3mg. bumps x3 times.<br />I have done oral doses from 5mg. to 10mg. 10mg. made me immobile for the whole trip and I couldn&#039;t sleep for additional 6 hours. So about 20 hours overall. A bit too heavy for my body. Friend tried 12mg. oral and had no body load, it was very nice trip for him. So yeah, 2C-P is different for every individual.<br /><br />Will try snorting 3mg. next. Thanks for report, not much info about this ROA.

Reported effects vary dramatically from sleepy to speedy and from sense enhancing to mind-numbing.<br />Users describe a speedy body load, predominantly at the beginning of the experiment and a kind of 5-MeO-DMT like dissociation rather at the end. The turned on body load in some people enhances erotic qualities as with 2-CB or 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy). Some visual effects are reported, especially at higher doses (10 mg and above). Enhanced pleasure when listening to music seems to be common.<br />In many cases, 5-MeO-MIPT in rather low doses up to 5 mgs is reported to be smooth, relaxing, friendly and sense enhancing. It is reported to produce emotionally lability. Some experience the coming up period as being somewhat cold and shivery. To prevent dehydration drink a lot during the experiment.<br />Smoked, it can produce a rush including trippiness. Visual effects are more often reported when smoked than after oral ingestion. The acute rushing phase lasts about 30 min and then declines slowly producing a trippy feeling for the next few hours, with baseline reached in 6-7 hrs. So the total duration of smoked-5-MeO-MIPT is comparable to an oral dose experiment in higher doses.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I will definitely give it a try soon :D

It has strong stimulant effects but that doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t be a psychedelic. 2C-P is a stimulant too. buy-jwh.com has 5-MeO-MiPT in stock. That&#039;s where I got my 2C-P too. But for some reason they don&#039;t accept new customers through their registration form right now so you have to contact them directly for a new account.

Also Pentedrone is about twice as potent so... VALUE!!! ;D<br />That should keep me researching for a while so you can expect experience reports! :D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23942.msg254549#msg254549">Quote from: MightyMouse on May 23, 2012, 10:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">just google rape it a bit, price is subjective. ive seen it go for 50 usd per G, up to 200 usd per G. all dpends on source n quality you want altho the 50 per g was &quot;decent&quot; but was cut more then 20% of the way in this researchers mind. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;ve got mine for 35€ and AFAICT it&#039;s very pure.

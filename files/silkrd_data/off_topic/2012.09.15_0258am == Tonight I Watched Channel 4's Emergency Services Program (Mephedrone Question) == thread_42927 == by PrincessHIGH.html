				Needed to take my mind off those irritating Mt Gix tools!<br /><br />On 4oD of course, damn those adverts now! Too fookin many of &#039;em<br /><br />The first episode can be watched here:<br /><br />http://www.channel4.com/programmes/999-whats-your-emergency/4od#3411759<br /><br />I found it really insightful, but it was very biased, of course, it being from the emergency services prospective, which I guess was the programs intention!<br /><br />I have been dabbling to and throw with the idea of doing it for a while, but I&#039;m a bit nervous when it comes to trying new things. I just stick to what I know, which is coke and weed, and that&#039;s pretty much it, boring I know lol! However, variety is the spice of life, and life needs to be lived. Plus, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m missing out on, and I&#039;m curious. So I guess, I&#039;ve come to the time in my life where experimentation is necessary!<br /><br />Can it be compared to coke? How long does it take to feel the full effects? What is the comedown like?&nbsp; What can I do to limit the comedown? Last but not least, will it turn me into a insane prick like on that program? Worried about that one the most lol! Bubble did not make them bubbly at all! :o<br /><br />Excellent program to watch, especially if your into it, don&#039;t miss out!<br /><br />Would much appreciate your thoughts on this! Cheers! :)

				As long as you get the genuine stuff and take an amount that&#039;s reasonable, you&#039;ll be totally fine. <br /><br />Obviously on TV they&#039;re gonna show you the most extreme people. That guy likely took way too much, or shit that was cut, whilst at the same time being a complete and utter bellend with emotional repression issues and a personality disorder. <br /><br />You can&#039;t completely rule out the possibility that you&#039;ll be the 1/100000 person that has some adverse reaction to it and ends up in hospital but the chances of that are probably the same for coke/E etc. <br /><br />Drone is actually one of the best powders imo. It blows shit like M1 out of the water.. It&#039;s not quite as good as high quality coke but its very close, you do genuinely get a real rush off it.. And the comedown is less than coke so that&#039;s a bonus. I say go for it and try not to worry. <br /><br />If you want a recommendation, Limetless is a moderator here who sells drone, he has a good reputation and top shelf stuff, for a good price.

				I watched the 999 program, and let me tell you that program is completely biased to make the chemical and the people that use it look bad. It stated they were getting a gram of &#039;bubble&#039; for around £10. I will be willing to bet on my life that it wasn&#039;t actually Mephedrone but something very shitty but similar chemical wise, but not the same euphoric effects as true 4MMC like you get here on SR.<br />Ever had MDMA? Its similar to that, only lasts around 30minutes but it&#039;s a lot more rushy, intense and simulating like cocaine. It makes you feel really exhilarated, excited, chatty, dancey and euphoric. If you keep your first line around 100mg then 40-50mg every 30minutes after, you&#039;ll keep a nice soild buzz.<br />I&#039;d also say, just like MDMA you don&#039;t want to do it to often. Around once every 4/6 weeks. Remember its a research chemical so its not fully known what the long term effects are gunna be. Some of the side effects people experience after heavy sessions is vaso-constriction (bluing of the extremities, elbows and knee&#039;s) to avoid this, keep your dose low or take a supplement like L-Arginie which is a vaso-dilator. <br />Overall it&#039;s a very fun drug, but does have it&#039;s side effects and does have the very real potential to be abused if you have an addictive personality. <br />Just like Kappacino said, talk to Limetless. He sells the best stuff and he knows everything and anything about it.<br />Have fun! :)

				I saw the programme too and yes of course it was biased towards the emergency services, there have been a few studies done on Mephedrone, I would advise caution if your prone to depression , there have been a number of self harm / suicide deaths that have been associated to Mephedrone, but this is with continuous use , avoid the usual like alcohol and and CNS substances. People report the come down can be severe and people have reported that this can last a few days .....Would be interested to know of any HR advice for this <br /><br />The biggest issue with Mephedoen is the re bound effect which as gtgeorgz mentioned if your prone do addiction I would avoid this stuff, its believed that the bromine in the Mephedrone increases the re bound effect , I have read a post on SR where people were washing the Mephedrone to wash out the Bromine .With increased doses comes the increased likelihood of negative effects. These can include:&nbsp; desire to redose, uncomfortable changes in body temperature (sweating and chills), heart&nbsp; palpitations, impaired short term memory, insomnia, tightened jaw muscles, grinding teeth&nbsp; (trismus and bruxia), muscle twitching, nystagmus, dizziness, light headedness, vertigo.&nbsp; Some user reports collated on erowid.org suggest vasoconstriction when snorted: pain and&nbsp; swelling in nose and throat, sinusitis. This is a great paper from a clinical perspective http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/32134/InTech-Mephedrone_related_fatalities_in_the_united_kingdom_contextual_clinical_and_practical_issues.pdf<br /><br />I would be interested to hear from people has there been much of a change in quality&nbsp; from pre ban to now .<br /><br />We do know that from tox reports in Ireland&nbsp; that Coke is being cut with Mephedrone as well Hope more people join in the thread

But I&#039;ve got some of Limetless&#039; pre-ban crystal coming so it will be interesting to see how that compares!<br />As far as know there are different types of 4MMC, the Chinese version and the Indian version, both of which were from the pre-ban days. But to understand this fully you need to speak to Limetless as he knows it better than most lol. :)

				Its interesting to see how much pre ban MCAT is still around on site like this ....Wonder is the pre ban MCAT was made before the ban or do we have various outlets still making this and does it make its way onto the street or stay on sites like SR

				As HarmReduction said, Avoid this stuff if you&#039;re prone to addiction.<br /><br />I was a heroin addict for over 10 years, and was &quot;clean&quot; for years (taking Subutex for maintenance)..so Yes, I have an addictive personality. Wasn&#039;t much into uppers..until Meph analogs came around. <br />I was smoking and injecting the stuff, and pretty much got psychologically addicted to it right away.<br />I was doing it all day, everyday, for 6 months.<br />It&#039;s a potent vasoconstrictor, and this ended up causing permanent damage. <br />I had 2 strokes, and a heart attack. Became a walking skeleton, too embarrassed to walk out of the house because I looked BAD.<br />Even after the heart attack, I still wanted and did more. <br /><br />I ended up trading my addiction to meph, back to heroin because heroin is safer.<br />If I&#039;m going to indulge my addictive personality, might as well do something thats less likely to kill me.<br /><br />Most people who use it won&#039;t take it that far though.<br />If you buy small amounts than you&#039;ll probably do fine. <br /><br />It can be used safely, just tread lightly, and be aware of the risks involved.<br />The cathinones can be real tricky with some personalities.<br /><br />

				***By &quot;Safer&quot; i was talking about less damage on the body when taken daily.<br />Opiates are generally well tolerated and gentle on the body (until withdrawals of course!!). ***<br /><br />The cathinones seem rather harmless until taking large amounts, and it only seems to be a small percentage of the population who have these adverse reactions to their health. <br />I suspect that its in people with compromised liver function, heart problems, or with psychological issues.<br /><br />Princess, YES...I&#039;m in a good place now, exactly back where I should be, and that was very kind of you! :)<br /><br />I would also like to point out, just as Limitless pointed out....that even though I was taking the cathinones everyday for an extended amount of time, there were NO withdrawals, only cravings..and that went away rather quickly.<br />I like the cathinones much more than amphetamines, they can be a useful tool.<br />....and if you are in good health and sound mind, there should be no problem :) <br /><br /><br />

I am guessing about 75mg would be sensible, but that may be too little or too much? Can you please share your thoughts on this?<br /><br />How long will it take to feel the full effects of the high? Obviously, everyone is different, but a time window would be helpful.<br /><br />I am a &#039;very experienced&#039; coke user, would this have any impact on the high, I wouldn&#039;t plan on mixing it on the first line, but if I don&#039;t like the taste of it might have to for the second. I have heard Meph is a very acquired taste! Is this true?<br /><br />Also, damage limitation for the come down, I don&#039;t do that &#039;feeling like a bag of shit&#039; in the morning feeling, if I can help it. Usually I find a combination of Melatonin, Vitamin C, Vitamin B, and L-Tyrosine, (don&#039;t know if your familiar with any of those, I&#039;m happy to explain if your not), washed down with a pint of full fat milk does the trick 90% of the time, when I couldn&#039;t refrain myself from doing too much of a good thing! For the other 10% of the time I reach for the Valiums! Would the same apply with this, or do I need to treat my come down differently?<br /><br />Cheers!&nbsp; :)

				No worries, I always love to chat breeze about it so ya did me a favour haha. :P<br /><br />Anyway, I do 75-100mg lines in very thin long rails and not slugs like people sometimes do for Blow. My stuff lasts around 45 minutes with about 15-30 mins residual afterward. Onset of mine is around 2-5 minutes from snorting and I fully recommend snorting it by the way. <br /><br />And as you&#039;ll probably find out sooner or later I am well into Blow as well, you&#039;ll probably read me talking about it on here at some stage lol. I actually frequently mix the two together but I&#039;ll say now doing that is extremely intense. It gives you a huge initial rush (biggest rush I&#039;ve ever had) and then you get a kind of body orgasm from it and a &quot;moment of clarity&quot; feeling in your head if you know what I mean? Mixing the two together is basically my favourite snorting combo. If you do do this then I recommend 75mg of Meph and say 75mg of blow (make sure it&#039;s 80%+). The first line is always a bit twangy with Meph but I find it&#039;s quite an overplayed thing, after maybe 1-2 you are golden though. <br /><br />Damage limitation, Meph is a hit and miss thing where it can either hit you quite hard or feel fuck all. I have been doing it for so long I usually just get lethargy and that&#039;s about it. Valium is the best for it, I always just pop 2 and I feel pukka. :)<br /><br />If you do decide to give it a spin I do hope you will come to me and sample my crystal because it really is spot on quality-wise. If you don&#039;t then I would recommend at least Googleyed&#039;s because I know his is legit also, from what I can gather it seems we are the only people with the genuine article although I might be wrong. I&#039;d also say that Meph is not a drug you should quibble over paying a few extra quid for either. It&#039;s a cheap drug as it is and yeah, back in the day you could buy grams of pure for around £10 but that was before the bans. People do still offer it at that price now but it&#039;s just not possible to be sold pure at those prices now. I mean, I produce my own and I don&#039;t sell it for that. Those kinds of prices either buy you severely cut or bogus product altogether like 4-MEC or something like that or even a combination of both. <br /><br />Anyway stay safe whatever you do and most importantly have fun! I hope you enjoy it as much as I and others do. :)

My stuff lasts around 45 minutes with about 15-30 mins residual afterward. Onset of mine is around 2-5 minutes from snorting and I fully recommend snorting it by the way. <br /><br />And as you&#039;ll probably find out sooner or later I am well into Blow as well, you&#039;ll probably read me talking about it on here at some stage lol. I actually frequently mix the two together but I&#039;ll say now doing that is extremely intense. It gives you a huge initial rush (biggest rush I&#039;ve ever had) and then you get a kind of body orgasm from it and a &quot;moment of clarity&quot; feeling in your head if you know what I mean? Mixing the two together is basically my favourite snorting combo. If you do do this then I recommend 75mg of Meph and say 75mg of blow (make sure it&#039;s 80%+). The first line is always a bit twangy with Meph but I find it&#039;s quite an overplayed thing, after maybe 1-2 you are golden though. <br /><br />Damage limitation, Meph is a hit and miss thing where it can either hit you quite hard or feel fuck all. I have been doing it for so long I usually just get lethargy and that&#039;s about it. Valium is the best for it, I always just pop 2 and I feel pukka. :)<br /><br />If you do decide to give it a spin I do hope you will come to me and sample my crystal because it really is spot on quality-wise. If you don&#039;t then I would recommend at least Googleyed&#039;s because I know his is legit also, from what I can gather it seems we are the only people with the genuine article although I might be wrong. I&#039;d also say that Meph is not a drug you should quibble over paying a few extra quid for either. It&#039;s a cheap drug as it is and yeah, back in the day you could buy grams of pure for around £10 but that was before the bans. People do still offer it at that price now but it&#039;s just not possible to be sold pure at those prices now. I mean, I produce my own and I don&#039;t sell it for that. Those kinds of prices either buy you severely cut or bogus product altogether like 4-MEC or something like that or even a combination of both. <br /><br />Anyway stay safe whatever you do and most importantly have fun! I hope you enjoy it as much as I and others do. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for being so informative. Really appreciate it.<br /><br />I generally do long thin lines. I tend to have high purity coke, and get well pissed off if I don&#039;t. My phisosphy is life is too short for shit drugs, if it can be helped!<br /><br />It would be interesting to share your opinions in blow with you, as this is my area of expertise. I look forward to hearing you talk about it.<br /><br />I love intensity, and the full body orgasm sounds quite euphoric. If it&#039;s half as good as you describe it, I&#039;m going to find it very enjoyable, to say the least.&nbsp; I will take your reccommendation by doing one or two lines of Meph only first before I take the plunge, it will also make me have better control over the situation, which is what I prefer, especially when venturing into the unknown.<br /><br />You&#039;ve got the privillage of your merchandise popping my bubble for the first time lol! And no question I will be coming to you. I have never worried about paying &#039;the right price&#039; for quality. After all, in life you get what you pay for!<br /><br />Should be towards end of the week, and I will give you a review afterwards, it will also give me something to look back on, as my first time should be remembered!<br /><br />Thanks again. Your very helpful.&nbsp; :)

Great! The night would still be young, and I would still have time to play with my coke, if I&#039;m not completely out of it. Hopefully not, because I do like my three day benders, being a lightweight is NOT my style! I hate to admit it, but I have a feeling I might be, first time and all that, but who knows? It&#039;s going to be fun to try something new, as I haven&#039;t done that in years! Looking forward to it!

				You´re probably a whole load more sensible than me. But heres my story for what it´s worth--<br /><br />I started with drone when it was still legal, just a gram here and there. The beauty of it is that it was cheap. legal and the effects were a speedy mix of coke and MDMA, also good for sessions with the missus, makes you horny as fcuk.. Anyways, I compare it to meth taken down a few notches. You can still function on it.. The danger lies in amphetamine psychosis.. As it was explained to me, you can do a certain amount of any uppers until the lack of sleep makes you go sideways.. for me it was 4 or 5 days, hard to pinpoint exactly when my mind broke, perhaps when I started getting overly parranoid, but almost certainly when i was playing bumper cars in my 4 litre Range Rover-.. <br /><br />Basically its very addictive and hard to see that your overdoing it.. word of wisdom (if your knees or elbows start going blue,&nbsp; you should definitely stop) [edit]<br /><br />other than that its a fuking good drug.. Although were the guinneapigs for the RC world, so dont be surprised if you reach 50 and end up with extra fingers and shit.. <br /><br />Taraa<br />ACE

				Its the sort of thing you should do every couple of months, a gram to yourself but no more.&nbsp; Do it every weekend and you are in for some early interventions.&nbsp; Early interventions is basically psychosis.&nbsp; So the more you do it the more voices you will hear and the more you think people are out to get you.&nbsp; Good luck and don&#039;t be stupid!

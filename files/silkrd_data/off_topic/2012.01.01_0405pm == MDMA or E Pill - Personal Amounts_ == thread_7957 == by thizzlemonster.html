				hey guys. happy new years lol. was just wondering if anyone knows whats to be considered personal amounts of MDxx or E pills. what got me thinking about this was a &quot;lost&quot; shipment of about 10 E pills over December. so of course i started thinking &quot;oh shit, would that be considered more than a personal amount&quot;? i couldnt really find much info on it. so i figured id ask you guys. i live in the US by the way, an from what i hear anything over about 3 or 4 pills &quot;can&quot; be considered more than personal amounts in wich case they try to say its intent to sell. so yeah i just started thinkin about it an in really need an answer on this guys, kind freakin me out. thanks guys. happy new years!

				I imagine that it varies case by case, and each individual DA can use his own discretion for smaller amounts, but I seem to recall that the general threshold for intent to sell in the US is 10 pills.

				Whether it&#039;s a personal amount or not would depend on different factors, like if they were packaged in individual baggies, or if you had records of trying to sell (like texts). I don&#039;t think it really matters, it wouldn&#039;t be worth their time and energy to come knocking on your door over 10 pills, so I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if this is not any help, but I thought I might share that I was recently arrested with about 0.5g of MDA powder on my person. I live in the USA &amp; I am being charged with Possession of &quot;Ecstasy&quot; with Intent to Distribute, my bond for that charge was set at $10,000. I am not sure if the tests police run on substances would tell them if it were MDA, MDMA, MDEA, or just &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, so I don&#039;t know if it matters.<br />Anyway, half a gram is probably like 4, 5, 6 pills, so I&#039;d bet 10 pills would be considered &quot;intent to distribute&quot;. I don&#039;t think I would worry myself if I were you though, I don&#039;t think they usually go chasing down people who&#039;ve been sent drugs in the mail from another country right away. I had 10 pills seized from Schizofreen(if he actually sent any) and I never heard a peep from any kind of authority.<br /><br />Good luck sweetie, I hope everything is alright &amp; happy new year.

				wow thank you guys so much for all your input. ALL of your posts did help. so basically 3 to 4 pills &quot;can&quot; be considered to be intent to distribute but not always. i guess it comes down to the judge, how the pills are packaged, and some luck too. i suppose your all correct about them not doing anything about 10 pills, its just not worth the man power huh? so that is somewhat reassuring. but i think i will keep it to 5 pills at a time now, just so they dont think im trying to sell em. just so everyone knows all 10 of them were for me an my buddy, i dont sell pills. i go through too much stress to just sell them you know? its just not worth it to sell them to me. even if i could double my money i wouldnt do it. im not a drug dealer. i just dabble every so often. at any rate thank you guys for all your answers. all of you guys have helped me a lot. God Bless an PLUR.

				&nbsp;::)<br /><br />i dont understand why buyers get so paranoid.&nbsp; they have no proof that you actually ordered anything. all you have to say is that you did not order any drugs. if some douche sends drugs to your house, why is that your fault?

It has to be proven that you intended to supply the drugs. More often this is done based on a valuation (which are always disgustingly inflated and again shouldn&#039;t be hard to defend against with a real expert valuation), but sometimes it is calculated by just weight or # of pills/vials. This again can be defended by proving that you did not intend to receive that # or weight. Or by proving that you had a more serious than normal habit.<br />Depends on the precedent for the particular substance. For possession and intent to supply there are guidelines but for importation (evasion of prohibition, NOT trafficking charge) there are not guidelines just case law.<br />You could also just claim that you were sure the pills/powders were legal. So long as there is no supply charge then this is not really a crime (point towards cases where people have been charged for possessing inactive material that they thought was drugs etc..).

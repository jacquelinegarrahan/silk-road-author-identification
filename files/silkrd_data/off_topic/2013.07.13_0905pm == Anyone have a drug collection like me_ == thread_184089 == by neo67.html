				Nope. I keep some ganj, but I don&#039;t like having a big ol&#039; stash. It&#039;s just too tempting.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yeah it is a waste to do most of those on the drugs you&#039;re on now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d never touch MDMA with a depressive history....

				i used to have a pretty massive drug stash, left from years ago... mescaline, LSD, 4-aco-dmt, DMT, DPT, the makings for ayahuasca, coca leaves, poppy pods, research chems, pills and powders and liquids and... yeah. i needed a fear and loathing suitcase but i dont know that it would all fit in there... i&#039;ve been unloading bits and bobs that i dont think i&#039;ll ever use. i could use the cash for things i actually use on a regular basis.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can...&quot;<br /><br />keep your stash in the fridge. my house was once raided, and my entire stash survived and i avoided anything more than a paraphernalia charge, because no one looks in your fridge.

				My personal drug collection is frankly pretty shocking and I&#039;ve been trying to shirk it for a while. Finally the crew and I have managed to slowly get through a bit of it now that summer and festivals have come around. :)<br /><br />Well over 10g&#039;s of various mandy and a few grams of MDA, over 7grams of 80%+ cocaine, countless XTC pills and caps with various ingredients and weights, several grams of ketamine, a bit of meth, couple grams of both M1 and 4MMC, just under 500mg of 2cb, quite a lot of 5-MeO-MIPT (Moxy) caps, 5 Mayan acid tabs @ 180ug (about to restock with some more different tabs though), just over a gram of amphetamine sulphate and 50mg of Xanax powder and a few 2mg pills. Also about 238332 vodka bottles. ;)<br /><br />This is the collection that I have now, about a month into the summer break. Hopefully we&#039;ll finish this collection come September/October time.

				As a Ecstasy user I just enjoy keeping a collection of my most favourite pills. I am currently having around 20 different high quality pills. Sure it might be tempting to pop one but I enjoy collecting them!

That is one fine ass drug collection right there....how long did it take to build this collection friend? you must of spent a shit load on accumulating the goods!? hopefully mine will be similar to this collection pretty soonish (depending on funds)<br /><br />Does anyone find that their addicted to the process of actually buying drugs,especially from SR, not just addicted to drugs themselves(suppose it all factors in to the overall addictiveness of drugs)

				Ha few months, I put the money in and then just charge my friends for it when we go party/festival whatever,&nbsp; so to be fair it pays for itself.&nbsp; Yeah I do find myself a bit addicted to ordering from SR but I think that can only be a good thing. ;D&nbsp; Plus where and how I&#039;ve hidden my drug collection I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll never be found. <br /><br />And, all the best with getting off SSRI&#039;s man.

				Wow, what a nice thread.<br /><br />Well I don&#039;t have such collection since I am not experienced in so many different drugs.<br />Always used to buy my weed IRL and only had weed. After finding SR though things have changed. <br />Indeed I think it is addictive to just buy from SR.<br />For the moment I am very happy about my little collection.<br />Good weed, dmt, lsd. I would like to add as well some mushrooms.<br />Really thought about the idea to have more, just to have treating my friends, but since money isn&#039;t a real factor for me these days I have only substances that I enjoy. I am maybe are against other chemicals, even thought I know they can be really nice, but I like only those for the moment.<br /><br />Hehe, really guys you made me smile a lot. In a really admirable way. Keep on people. <br />Love SR and it&#039;s forum. Amazing people around!!<br /><br />haha, just smoked some nice weed<br /><br />Adamiz

				I enjoy having different types of DMT, each of different strength. This is good so that I can always pack the same sized amount but if I want to have a stronger trip put in the better product and vice versa. As well as different types of ketamine, some easier on the nose for snorting and some for other ROA. Having different stimulants to mix with different types of MDMA is also pretty handy.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Oh and to the collection of pills thing, I have tried the same thing with little success. One thing I am proud of is 2 pills from about 7 years ago which I still have stored away. ;D

I may give it a go though---i&#039;m currently on 2 pills (Mortal kombats)--if your talking about xtc pills that is.<br /><br /><br />Keep your collections coming in guys..........i&#039;m having way too much fun reading all of them hehehe. <br /><br />Peace.

				We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...

I too like having my options open, like a drug for every kind of situation, every kind of party, etc. I am tempted now and then but i know i wont get the most out of them as i am currently on shitty prescription medication for depression and psychosis,i know it sucks! p.s; i&#039;d like to point out here that i&#039;m not American hehe i&#039;m just becoming one lol <br /><br />Ive just realised that my collection didn&#039;t include measuremnets: so here goes;<br /><br />MDMA: 3 gram (from different vendors)<br />XTC pils; 2 (not alot i know)<br />Mephedrone: 5 gram (from different vendors and dealers ;)<br />ketamine; 1 gram, another 1 on its way.<br />NBOME; Lost count; probably 25 tabs in total (love the stuff)<br />LSD; Only the 4 tabs<br />Speed; 1 gram wet.<br /><br />ermm..need weed though!!.. although I&#039;m not a huge fan.i hate the paranoia!

Like i&#039;m on anti-psychotics right now so i shouldn&#039;t really mix any drugs with them but currently in the process of getting of them.

I need to start buying more stuff NOW!

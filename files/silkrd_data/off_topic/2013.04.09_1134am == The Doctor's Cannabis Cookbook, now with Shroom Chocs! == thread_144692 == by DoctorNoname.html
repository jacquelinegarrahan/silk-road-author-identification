				So here is a few of my recipes that I use to make edibles, I figured I may as well share them with you all. They can either be made with good ol&#039; cannabutter or you can be a real man and use concentrates so you can figure out dosage in a more practical way. Most of them are better made with concentrates like the chocolates for example because most people don&#039;t make cocoa cannabutter.<br /><br />**** DOCTOR&#039;S ORIGINALS****<br /><br />What we will end up with is what I like to call the Doctor&#039;s Originals, they are like werthers originals but will get you stoned!<br /><br />What you will need:<br /><br />One heavy based pan<br />one regular pan<br />A confectioners/jam makers thermometer thing<br />100gr cannabutter<br />1tsp lecithin<br />300ml heavy cream<br />1tsp salt<br />150g sugar<br />4tbsp golden syrup<br />4tbsp water<br />1tsp Vanilla extract<br /><br /><br />Step 1<br /><br />In a regular pan melt the butter, cream and lecithin together, you may need to use a stick blender or similar to get the lecitihin to properly emulsify. Once this is done set it to one side.<br /><br />Step 2<br /><br />Take your sugar, syrup, water and salt and put them in the heavy based pan. Gently heat whilst stirring until all the ingredients are dissolved. Bring to the boil.<br /><br />Step 3<br /><br />Gradually add your cream/cannabutter/lecithin mixture to the heavy based pan whilst continually stirring. Now you need to gradually heat this mixture whilst stirring for about 20-25 minutes until it reaches the &#039;Firm Ball&#039; stage on your confectioners thermometer.<br /><br />Step 4<br /><br />Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, mix for a minute or two.<br /><br />Step 5<br /><br />Pour into either a pre-lined 20cmX20cm tin or pour into an ice cube tray or silicone mould you are confident will withstand temperatures around 100c<br /><br />Step 6<br /><br />Restrain yourself for 90mins-2hrs whilst they cool and then you&#039;re done!<br /><br /><br /><br />They really are great, after a couple of minutes of sucking you start to feel stoned and you&#039;re only getting more mashed from there.<br /><br />My current doses are enough for 3 or four hits easily so I would advise putting it aside in some cling film once you start to feel the effects, you can always come back to it.<br /><br />I wanted to share this with the community because I am one of those who is not really effected by digested marijuana but these work great! You just have to make sure you suck on them and don&#039;t crunch them down<br /><br />****DOC CHOCS****<br /><br />Okay so this is about as simple as cannabis recipes get but it works great for a number of reasons and can be done really easily.<br /><br />You need some cannabis concentrate, some nice chocolate, some raw cocoa butter and some moulds.<br /><br />1.First you want to decarb the concentrate into a small amount of cocoa butter I usually twice as much cocoa butter as concentrate. You want to heat them together for about 20 minutes at around 115C either in an oil bath or in the oven, I use the hotplate/stirrer personally. Lecithin can be added at this point<br /><br />2.Melt the bar of chocolate either however you want but then you need to fold in the canna/cocoa mix until they are thoroughly blended.<br /><br />3. Now all you need to do is pour them into moulds of your choosing(ice cube trays, silicone moulds, etc) and then divide the number of chocolates by the amount of concentrate used and you have your dosage!<br /><br /><br />****CANNA FUDGE****<br /><br />This recipe is from UK420 so all props to Joolz for this one, it is take from (CLEARNET):http://www.uk420.com/boards/index.php?showtopic=164296<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />&nbsp;butter to grease the tin<br /><br />&nbsp;300ml milk or cream or any combination of the two<br />&nbsp;350g golden caster sugar<br />&nbsp;100g Canna Butter<br />&nbsp;1 tsp vanilla extract<br />&nbsp;grated chocolate (optional)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Method<br /><br />&nbsp;Grease an 18cm square cake tin.<br /><br />&nbsp;Put the milk, sugar and butter in a heavy-based saucepan. Heat slowly, stirring all the time, until the sugar has dissolved and the butter melted.<br />&nbsp;Bring to the boil and boil for 15-20 minutes, stirring all the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;When the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (115°C on a sugar thermometer), remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Leave to cool for 5 minutes.<br /><br />&nbsp;Beat the mixture with a spoon for a few minutes until it starts to thicken and the gloss disappears.<br /><br />&nbsp;Pour into the prepared tin and leave to set at room temperature (do not put it in the fridge).<br /><br />&nbsp;Once set, cut the fudge into small squares and store in a sealed container. <br /><br />&nbsp;You can use any flavouring you like , just omit the vanilla<br />&nbsp;Peanut butter is a nice variation, just stir in a couple of heaped table spoons at the the end<br /><br />To make it with concentrates just dissolve the concentrate in the butter, decarbing takes place during the cooking process so all you need to do is divide the amount of concentrate by the number of pieces of fudge!<br /><br />I&#039;m working on a few more things so keep an eye out to see if there is any you like the looks of!<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Decarbing actually takes place during this particular cooking process so you don&#039;t need to worry about that.<br /><br />Dosing is an independant thing, my butter is from old harvests where I would just chuck lb&#039;s of trim that I have bubble hashed into a pot with a few sticks of butter. It&#039;s difficult to say how strong my butter is but it has melted plenty of people.<br /><br />You could make 20 doses out of this recipe easily so I would suggest around 10g of weed for the butter for a 0.5g dose per edible.<br /><br />Hope that helps<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I just wanted to add this tea recipe that I received from LaBlueGirl, it seems like a decent plan for shrooms.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is one of the better Tea recipes that I have seen out there that removes all of the mushroom bits, if he has a hard time with them.. Some people, as I am sure you know, cant keep them down, hate the taste or texture of them..With this recipe he wont have to deal with any of that..<br /><br />First thing to do is to make sure the mushroom pieces you have are finely divided. WAIT UNTIL JUST BEFORE YOU MAKE THE TEA before chopping them, as the more finely diced they are, the quicker the psilocybin will degrade due to exposure to oxygen. On the other hand, the smaller they are, the more easily they will give up the psilocybin to the extracting liquid. Dice them into fairly fine pieces... maybe twice the size of a sesame seed.<br /><br />Heat a cup or a cup and a half of water in a pot until it is boiling. Add about a teaspoon of lemon juice, remove pot from heat, wait about thirty seconds and toss in the shroom bits and 1500 mg of crushed up vitamin C tablets (any kind, but the chewable variety will probably taste better). Stir it every few minutes, squishing the mushroom bits against the bottom of the cup or the sides as you do so.<br /><br />After ten or fifteen minutes, strain out the bits of mushroom from your tea, and toss them into a SECOND batch of almost-boiling water and half a teaspoon of lemon juice (no vitamin C this time). You won&#039;t need a full cup of water this time... maybe a half cup. Put the first cup of &quot;tea&quot; aside to cool further. As before, stir the new water/shroom mixture every few minutes, squish them up well. After ten or fifteen minutes, strain out the shroom bits, pressing out as much water as you can, and discard the shroom bits. By this time there should be very little, if any, active ingredients in the bits, it will all be in the water/lemon juice mixture.<br /><br />Combine the two portions of &quot;tea&quot; into one big mug, toss in a spoonful or two of instant coffee and add enough sugar so that you don&#039;t gag when you drink the mix. NO MILK or CREAM, though, or anything fatty.<br /><br />Wait until the resulting mix is cool enough that you can drink it within five to ten minutes. The idea is to get all of the psilocybin/psilocin into your bloodstream at the same time.<br /><br />Essentially, you are extracting the psilocybin and psilocin from the mushroom tissue. The hot water does most of the work, but the lemon juice acidifies the water so that the extraction is more thorough. The coffee is to provide caffeine, which allows the body to absorb the psilocybin/psilocin more rapidly and completely. The vitamin C is an anti-oxidant keeps the more fragile psilocin molecule from breaking down too rapidly.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				You take your bud and your butter and put them in a pan with some water, boil for 6-12 hours and then strain off. When you allow it to cool you should be left with a hard disc of cannabutter on the surface.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				You just need enough water to stop the butter from getting too hot so just make sure there is always at least as much water as butter.<br /><br />You can use it in any recipe, just have a look through some of Delia Smith&#039;s cake recipes or something and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find something simple to do with it<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget you can make cannabuttercream icing as well<br /><br />Jah Bless

				So I figured I&#039;d pop in the method I use for making the shroom chocolates I have listed, it&#039;s pretty simple and very effective at masking the horrible taste of shrooms.<br /><br />So all you need is a double boiler(or a glass bowl and pan of water), a coffee grinder, a bag of shrooms and some chocolate.<br /><br />The exact method I use is as follows:<br /><br />Place your shrooms in a coffee grinder and turn them into dust, for this recipe I&#039;ll be using 11g of dried Psilocybe Cubensis shrooms which makes 4 healthy doses. I always throw in an extra gram of shrooms to account for any lost chocolate that sticks to the bowl, therefore each dose should be 2.5g.<br />150g chocolate, milk, dark or flavoured, whatever you fancy is melted over boiling water and then allowed to cool a little off the heat. Mix in the mush dust and leave it a little longer to cool.<br />Now you want to pour it in to a mould, you can just use an ice cube tray or get fancy like I do with silicone moulds and then put it in the fridge or freezer. If you fill a 24 cube ice cube tray for example you know that about 6 cubes will be a trip provided you have filled them evenly.<br /><br />I always weigh things before and after and I&#039;m extra careful to make sure everything ends up as even as possible. I tend to end up with 8x18g blocks (roughly 1.25g/block)when I make them so you can see a little is lost to the bowl and everything, as such it is worth adding the extra 10% at the start to account for this. Of course if you are just making them at home for yourself it doesn&#039;t really matter but I like to be incredibly anal about dosing, particularly with psychedelics.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I think this is a good place to share my canna-coco recipe :D<br /><br />-1 stick of butter<br />-3 grams of good hash (5 if it&#039;s not that good)<br />-milk<br />-cocoa powder<br />-some water<br />-pot<br />-stove<br /><br />Heat some water (just enough to protect the butter from going over 100°C) in the pot and add the butter. While the butter is dissolving, chop the hash into powder. Once the water starts boiling, turn down the heat to just enough to keep it simmering and add the hash. Wait 20-30 minutes while giving the mixture a little stir every five minutes.<br />Pour it into a container (preferably metal as it allows the mixture to cool quicker) and let it cool to room temperature or put it in a fridge. It is important to not move the container once the butter starts solidifying so it can form a solid sheet at the surface. Once the butter is completely solidified (the container must not feel warm at this point), simply take it out of the container and dispose of the water. There might be a thin layer of brown/gray hash goo left on the underside of the butter sheet. Just scrape that off.<br />Make a cup of hot chocolate and dissolve a tablespoon of cannabutter in it. The taste is fucking amazing and so is the high. Takes a long time to kick in though.

				Thats a great recipe, if you mix the final beverage with a hand blender you get a nice frothy head and sort of emulsify the butter into it a little better. I figured that one out after drinking many a buttery beverage and getting fed up of the surface butter.<br /><br />I guess adding a little lecithin would probably help too, it is always a great addition to anything cannabis, at least with edibles.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

Basically it is what I heat and mix the hash and cocoa butter with lecithin before adding it to the chocolate, I always add 0.2g to the first batch and 0.1g to every subsequent batch to account for what sticks to the beaker and is generally lost in the bowl, etc.<br /><br />So I just filled the beaker with milk, threw in the stir bar and turned it on, the result was the most scientific looking Bhang I&#039;ve ever seen. I have no idea how much was in there, probably around 250mgs given that I&#039;ve decarbed 40g of hash in there over the last fortnight that&#039;s not bad in terms of efficiency. <br /><br />I think it worked a little better with the cocoa butter and the milk, it didn&#039;t taste anywhere near as sickly as it usually does with butter and I&#039;m feeling pretty baked a couple of hours after drinking. <br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

Basically it is what I heat and mix the hash and cocoa butter with lecithin before adding it to the chocolate, I always add 0.2g to the first batch and 0.1g to every subsequent batch to account for what sticks to the beaker and is generally lost in the bowl, etc.<br /><br />So I just filled the beaker with milk, threw in the stir bar and turned it on, the result was the most scientific looking Bhang I&#039;ve ever seen. I have no idea how much was in there, probably around 250mgs given that I&#039;ve decarbed 40g of hash in there over the last fortnight that&#039;s not bad in terms of efficiency. <br /><br />I think it worked a little better with the cocoa butter and the milk, it didn&#039;t taste anywhere near as sickly as it usually does with butter and I&#039;m feeling pretty baked a couple of hours after drinking. <br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nice! Being creative is what cooking with cannabis and cooking and general is all about. You&#039;ve got to work with what&#039;s available :)

				I only ever buy it when I have plans for a bender. I generally finish it up (along with a lady or 2) the night of. Not a regular user just when I wanna party.

				After I had a brief stint of IV H use in my 20s, my tolerance for anything develops quickly and almost immediately. Sad, but true. I also think it&#039;s because my body doesn&#039;t create dopamine at the same levels as others.

				About an hour but i have serious doubts any real cocaine has ever entered my system and if there was any it was marred behind the other filler crap thats no doubt in street coke, ive rarely bought it, paid over the odds when i did for good stuff but it still does very little to me (either all my friends fall prey to the placebo effect too easily or im just a freak)

				Not very keen on the stuff.&nbsp; Any time in the past inhalation of 1g seems to last me about an hour and I really never could understand why so many find it so great.&nbsp; Never tried the freebase, don&#039;t know if I would ever want to.

				A few hours to a few weeks<br />The key to coke is ALWAYS WASH WITH ACETONE.&nbsp; I dont know why but it makes it not so jonesie IMO<br />Coke is more potent than people think.&nbsp; Tiny bumps do not make you jones, when lines and rails do.

				How would you &quot;wash with acetone&quot; in the freebase/extraction process? I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s better to use Ammonia as opposed to Baking soda also, but haven&#039;t tried that yet.

However, MDxx and MDMA are fantastic experiences, I definitely recommend trying them– you&#039;ll feel at one with the world, a piece of it, and you it; energy pulsates over your skin; music melds with you, and you become one with any people around you. Make sure you have people to chat with (at the very least online) and if possible, a pet to pet or person to cuddle. It&#039;s a truly fantastic experience; the only unpleasantry is the letdown afterwards; but I&#039;ve found that to be quite therapeutic.

				Thanks!&nbsp; I am not planning on taking X pills, I know them to be full of amphetamines.&nbsp; I would be taking pure mdma, well hopefully.&nbsp; What I received before was widely acclaimed and I still have access to it.&nbsp; I never did take it myself, never had a good opportunity and it all got snatched up quick.&nbsp; Forgot to mention, I was also wondering about Ketamine.&nbsp; Can you snort K?&nbsp; What is that like, anyone with experience that can chime in?

				mdma is one of the most euphoric, wonderful and astonishing drugs you can take. i like to refer to it as chemical joy! soma believe it or not is actually one of my favorite drugs, i love to mix it with a small dose of hydrocodone and or morphine and i just drift off into a warm peaceful nod. surprisingly i find the body high to be very similar nitrous oxide. i say try mdma, mda, nitrous oxide, soma, maybe mxe or ketamine and ghb if you think you would like it. please take the time to thoroughly research anything you plan to take and dont hesitate to ask me if you have any questions. stay high my friend :)

				I never liked soma much either as pain meds or rec. Sure they made me louppy but not anyway that I enjoy and they never did much for my back pain. But, other people do like them so maybe its just me.<br /><br />Maybe you don&#039;t need to try anything new but improve on what you have experienced. Ie try a more exotic strain of weed or something like that.<br /><br />I always wanted to try opium just once if it ever was easily obtainable. Not something you see often. I hear ( don&#039;t know) that all the natural alkiloids are supposed to produce a mellow but interesting experience.

				Mary molly and Lucy are the best three things to ever happen to our species. If you don&#039;t want to do psychedelics (I cannot stress how much I disagree with this, but I do understand it.) <br /><br />Ketamine and MDMA would be my suggestions. <br /><br />IF you decide to try psychedelics, LSD and Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms.

				I was a little drunk when I posted the original post and neglected to mention I have in fact tripped on mushrooms about 10 times in my life.&nbsp; I do have pyschadelic experience I just don&#039;t want to trip right now.&nbsp; I see a lot of people suggesting MDMA, that will definitely be something I try in the next couple of months.&nbsp; All I hear is great things about it.&nbsp; I would also like to try opium, but do not want to order it from overseas (I am in the USA).&nbsp; The one time it was listed domestically in the last 6 or so months was when I didn&#039;t have any coins damnit!&nbsp; If anyone sees a domestic opium vendor let me know!&nbsp; I think I will be picking up some soma and first testing it out alone, then the next time pairing it with 7.5mg of oxycontin.&nbsp; I always study up on what drugs I do, which is partly the reason I have not tried a lot of them, lol.&nbsp; Thanks for all the feedback everyone.&nbsp; I am still a little curious about ketamine and the best way to take it and what it compares to out of the drugs I have done, if it even does.&nbsp; Also, is &quot;Lucy&quot; another name for LSD?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				Can you suggest a good LSD vendor on the road?&nbsp; Seems like an easy drug to sell adulterated being it is just a piece of paper.&nbsp; At the very least I have a buddy who really wants some LSD.&nbsp; Additionally, anyone know the federal guidelines on LSD?&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to order more than I care to handle in court if the worst happens.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

It will most likely be one of the best things you ever do and maybe become your favourite drug.<br />It really allows you to connect with people like you never have before. And when the drug wears off, you will be more confident with people and a more social person.<br />It&#039;s hard to describe in detail, but it has so many positives. There are plenty of good MDMA vendors on Silk Road.<br /><br />I would also recommend amphetamine (not meth). It has a pretty bad name to it, but it&#039;s not as bad as it&#039;s made out to be. You may find small amounts are very useful when trying to accomplish something. Plus it has a high similar (but weaker) to cocaine and it puts you in an awesome, energetic mood. An excellent vendor for speed is BoyMaster. I&#039;d recommend 30-40mg for a first-time user of BM&#039;s speed.<br /><br />Ketamine is always worth a try. it gives you a very dreamy experience for about 30 minutes (snorted). Don&#039;t mix with alcohol, weed, an opiate or a benzo though. That would just fuck you up.<br />In small doses, ketamine is similar to being drunk. Your mind is cloudy and your muscles relax. In higher doses, it is quite difficult to move and you close your eyes and see things. very enjoyable. project4 is a very, very reliable Ketamine vendor.<br /><br />

				Thanks Dingo and everyone else.&nbsp; I will def get my hands on some MDMA.&nbsp; I think I will also pick up some Ketamine and Soma.&nbsp; I will be sure to do adequate research before all experiments.&nbsp; I have my bitcoins tied up in weed right now but once I get some more set aside for personal use drugs I will pick all three of these up.&nbsp; Keep the suggestions coming everyone, this is fun.&nbsp; I have some concerts this summer, I will do some MDMA at least one night.&nbsp; Any other suggestions for concerts?

I&#039;d recommend trying it by itself a couple of times so the user is comfortable with the drug. Then they know what to expect and could t hen mix it with other drugs.

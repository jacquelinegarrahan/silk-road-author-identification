				Alright. So despite my personal extractions failing, I recently acquired some SR DMT.<br /><br />I smoked the first time today around noon. I sandwiched 50mg (at least what my scale said was so, it desperately needs a calibration) looked outside and the bare winter-torn trees&nbsp; started spindling, duplicating, forming into fractal shapes. A (real) hum in the distance from a power plant was heavily amplified, and I felt very alien. Closing my eyes I saw visuals of a face, and lots of colors, but very little open-eyed visuals except the popcorn ceiling was very fluid.<br /><br />I just smoked a second time, 10 hours later. Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t keep the smoke down for as long as I should&#039;ve, quickly spit it back up as it hurt too much, but I once again felt very weird and in an alien presence. Same effects as before, colors looked a bit more vivid open-eye, but no liftoff. <br /><br />Once again, I came down very quickly... and my body started telling me to run, run away. I feel intuitively that I want nothing to do with this stuff. It&#039;s scary. Both times I tripped I was in states where I could&#039;ve taken LSD and had a fantastic time. Yet both times on DMT, every part of my body&#039;s screaming... just don&#039;t do it. It&#039;s too scary.<br /><br />Should I listen to my body and not touch it again? I fear that if I&#039;m having &#039;bad&#039; trips with such a low dose that a higher dose will only become scarier. I don&#039;t believe in higher powers, alternate realities or aliens (at least not that any have contacted/tried to contact earth). If you do, then perhaps I don&#039;t want to know the truth.<br /><br />Regardless, it&#039;s scaring me. Your thoughts?

				I have been exactly where you have been.<br /><br />Everyone is telling me I am not smoking enough.<br /><br />I&#039;m still overwhelmed with the felling of being trapped in this delusional state.<br /><br />Really really scary.<br /><br />

				knock it off. its the boiling point man.&nbsp; you are just getting in some DMT and not breaking through<br /><br />some find it relaxing, other overwhelming.&nbsp; I find it at time overwhelming but love the come down off it. dmt does something great to my brain.<br /><br />but i def understand that feeling. its a little overwhelming, basically feels like that feeling when molly is about to pop off in ur brain or 2cb or mushrooms, etc.<br /><br />my advice, try actually breaking through, when you do, you wont bother giving a shit talking about this part.

				You should try Changa! You can work your way up to the breakthrough point, slow or fast depending on how big of hits you&#039;re taking (and the type of changa blend). It also extends and enhances the trip significantly.<br /><br />Also, some find that if you pop a few benzos 20 minutes pre-trip it can get rid of any pre-trip anxiety or negative thoughts during your journeys. :)

				I highly endorse smoking DMT while on a high dose of Ketamine, that&#039;s how I had my first and only breakthrough so far. It was magical, and the Ketamine all but completely removes the feelings of anxiety.

				I feel similarly about salvia - I&#039;ve pushed myself through large doses of it, but its kind of mentally traumatic; I tried it more times to see if I could enjoy it at all, but it always set me down a little shaken and uncomfortable.<br /><br />I feel like DMT hyperspace would be worth it, though. at least to know what an &quot;all the way&quot; dose is like.

				I was so scared to try DMT when I first extracted it myself.&nbsp; Two things have made my experiences amazing and I think are a must.<br /><br />1) Get a proper pipe, and learn how to smoke it correctly.&nbsp; I recommend the Glass Vapor Genie, you can see the vapor as you pull so you can judge your hits.&nbsp; Sandwiching DMT in a bong is a BAD way to smoke it.&nbsp; Technique is absolute a factor here.&nbsp; <br /><br />2) Make changa as said above!&nbsp; The harmalas in the mixture add such a comforting aspect to it, you can smoke 20mg of DMT and have a real experience for 20 minutes, bump it up as you feel comfortable.&nbsp; I&#039;ve broken through on changa on my balcony and instantly the sky opened and poured, lightening, wind... I felt like mother earth was speaking to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />DMT is not an everyday thing.&nbsp; It is however, an amazing, euphoric, SPIRITUAL journey that leaves you feeling at such peace its incredible.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve found MXE to help with the pre-flight jitters, its pretty good for that, just be careful not to do it at the end of an mxe binge, the extra dopamine/stimulating push can increase chances for panic/paranoia.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had bad DMT experiences, but they were when I didn&#039;t respect the drug and smoked too much with the wrong drugs in my system.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mixing changa with MDMA was a bad call for me, it&#039;s debated at the dmt-nexus whether it really does have any inherent risk but I experienced either serotonin syndrome or a panic attack, either way, not fun.&nbsp; <br /><br />Respect DMT and she will treat you well.&nbsp; Buy a vaporizer, it&#039;s worth it if you want to travel in hyperspace.

It&#039;s as if you stepped into the doorway of somewhere where are NOT welcome or at least not READY to be. Lower doses seems to be more friendly. I&#039;ve heard DMT is supposed to be opposite though, that you go to a warm welcoming place.&nbsp;

				Agree that changa is much easier to handle, literally and mentally.<br /><br />I just tried some 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin) for the first time and had an excellent time. It&#039;s very similar to the DMT space but not nearly so manic or unpredictable. Easy to ingest: dissolve in water. Nice duration, 2-3 hours. It&#039;s shroomy (obviously) and quite &quot;static&quot;, so you can bask in the experience as opposed to being shot head first out of a &quot;nuclear cannon&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s not cheap, but then nothing good ever is, and you don&#039;t need much - I went with the &quot;recommended&quot; 0.45mg/kg, so about 30mg.<br /><br />Now I would highly recommend 4-AcO-DMT as a low intensity warm up for anybody who wants to try DMT, but is unsure/inexperienced. If you don&#039;t like it for any reason, then I really don&#039;t think you&#039;ll like full blown DMT either. On the other hand if you do like it, you&#039;ll have had a good session at the training end of the pool before heading out to the deeper water...<br /><br />With either substance, a dark room at night is the best place to see what they have to offer. A lot of beauty is lost in daylight imho.<br /><br />I got my psilacetin from Evoluado, who&#039;s pretty new but was a pleasure to deal with.

				smoked my first DMT a week ago. <br />the first toke was also with mixed feelings, and i released the ugly smoke way to early.&nbsp; it was a strange short trip..<br />the next day i tried it again, more prepared, and it was awesome! <br />i&#039;ve put in some ravi shankar ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7QP_QdoNqU )<br />and it was like i finally found the breakthrough drug i was looking for! i almost cried!<br />lsd, shrooms, meskaline are way more interacting with reality that surrounds you.. <br />DMT sends you into another world! i love it!<br /><br />gonna try it in combination with ketamine, lsd and meskaline soon :)

				I feel the &#039;pre-flight anxiety&#039; is nothing to be worried about. I usually get it just a little or even a lot, you just have to go into it knowing that everything&#039;s going to be just fine. In fact it&#039;s probably going to be the most amazing/beautiful thing you&#039;ve ever seen if you breakthrough. Hell, it&#039;ll probably be the most amazing/beautiful thing you&#039;ve ever seen even if it&#039;s a sub-breakthrough dose and you&#039;ve never broken through before. There is a literally a world of difference between the two though, IMO don&#039;t even waste your DMT on sub breakthrough doses.<br /><br />That said, if you&#039;re really not ready for it, don&#039;t force yourself to do it; that&#039;s how I&#039;ve had my only negative DMT trip. (I forced myself to smoke even though I wasn&#039;t ready for it, AND ended up coughing/choking on it while blasting off into hyperspace. One of the guardians whom I had encountered previously was not pleased with me and did something to scare the living shit out of me.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150193.msg1034628#msg1034628">Quote from: zvp1014 on April 20, 2013, 02:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Once again, I came down very quickly... and my body started telling me to run, run away.

Your thoughts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No one can say what the &quot;truth&quot; really is regarding DMT, as it&#039;s all intangible in relation to reality as we normally perceive it. (I often wish I could bring a video camera with me.)&nbsp; The best comparison I can think of regarding if you should do it, if you want to know the &quot;truth&quot;, is the Matrix. What if you found out that the matrix was in fact the true form of reality, and this reality was occupied not by robots, but hyper-spatial entities completely beyond your conception? The movie Dark City also gives a pretty good example of how your perception of reality could change.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t worry about any stress/anxiety from lower doses carrying over into a breakthrough. Like someone else said, you&#039;re not even going to be concerned one iota about that once you breakthrough. I have also had that intuitive feeling to just stay the fuck away from this stuff. I personally have interpreted this as fear being due to the potential to shatter one&#039;s concepts of both self and reality. It has in fact done this to me, and I feel it&#039;s a good thing.<br /><br />A friend gave me probably the best advice for experiencing DMT (which I have still not mastered). This friend told me that the trick is complete and total immersion in the experience. You must completely give in to both the experience and the entities, you must be able to be able to completely let go, even let go of your body. I have not mastered this, but have gotten much better at it, and have had progressively better and better trips. I have this feeling that once I can completely let go, there are further levels of the trip to explore, almost breakthroughs within the breakthrough if you will.<br /><br />I went into DMT agnostic/atheist. I&#039;ve come out agnostic and probably atheist, up to this point. I&#039;ve seen beings thus far that are clearly more intelligent/powerful than human beings, but nothing that I can say is a god/creator of the universe/something that should be worshiped, or if they are they have not revealed themselves as such.<br /><br /><br />Here are some illustrations that somewhat resemble the places/beings I have seen (but not quite, the real thing blows away any description. Also, individual visions tend to vary):<br /><br />https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0a3tgeK951r73kpco1_500.jpg<br /><br />https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcboawvn7v1rhft3wo1_1280.jpg<br /><br /><br />I also recommend building the &#039;machine&#039;, it&#039;s super easy to build and consistently delivers breakthroughs.<br /><br />I could keep on talking about this for a long time. I&#039;d be glad to continue in this thread or privately if you like<br /><br /><br />Whatever you decide, PLUR.

				Good pics, cheers +1.<br /><br />I&#039;d also add that a beginner shouldn&#039;t get too hung up on breaking through ASAP. You can work up to that on the back of enjoyable sub experiences. A good sub-breakthrough session still pisses over everything else!<br /><br />A 20mg hit is likely to be easier to manage/ingest, and allows for vaping/inhaling to be practised without risking torching too much stuff.<br /><br />If you take this hit towards the end of a pleasurable 2C-x experience, or another &quot;fun&quot; psychedelic, it will likely provide an excellent platform for leaping off and boosting/extending the 20mg dose in a really good way. Haven&#039;t tried it with K yet (DM Turner liked that combo, but felt he was dissuaded from it by the entities) so might get around to trying it...

And this guy right here has some of the Changa, of which I plan on purchasing very soon I can add to his trip reports&nbsp; ;D .

				I have been experimenting with some changa recently and have had a couple of interesting experiences. The first time was a small dose that gave me a body high that felt like pressure in my head and a yellowing of my vision.&nbsp; The next day I had a few drinks and decided to try a larger dose. This gave me some light patterning visuals but also some bad anxiety,&nbsp; uncomfortable body high,&nbsp; and a hot flash where i felt like I needed to pace around and take off my shirt. Not fun at all.. <br /><br />So a few days later I decided to try a larger dose again but without any alcohol in my system. I also tried to take as big of hits as possible. I took four large hits and it was a completely different feeling. A warm pressure built up in my chest/head that turned into the most blissful body high I&#039;ve ever had. My jaw dropped but I was smiling at the same time. These bright waving patterns of color we&#039;re bleeding into my peripherals and everything I looked at had red, blue and green auras. It faded away after 3 or 4 minutes. I was amazed at how wonderful it made me feel, especially after that awful experience from a few nights before. And apparently I have only scratched the surface.<br /><br />So I guess my point is even with previous bad experiences DMT still has the potential to do good things. I will be trying a larger dose next time and see how far I can go. :)

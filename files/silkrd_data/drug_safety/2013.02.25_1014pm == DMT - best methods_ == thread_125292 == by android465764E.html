				Gonna give DMT a go this week.<br /><br />Just wondering what people would advise as the best method for using it?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that most people just smoke it, but you have to be quick(?) as effects take hold before you even get a chance for a second toke. (Ō_o) <br /><br />Can&#039;t I just use an empty gel cap, or even just a Rizla bomb?<br /><br />Any thoughts? <br />

				You&#039;re going to need an MAOI to use DMT orally (which can have dangerous interactions with many molecules, specifically amines), but your best best is to buy an oil pipe &quot;glassdick&quot; and learn how to use it. Then, without burning the deems (YUCK!), take 2 of the biggest hits you can muster off of a 30-40mg bowl. You should be out of your body in no time! ; ) Consult the DMT nexus for more conscise info.<br /><br />Respect the power, and enjoy ; )

				you need the mao because otherwise the DMT will be broken down in your stomach before being taken up in your blood. <br />eating DMT is done in Ayahuasca (= combination DMT and strong MAO). <br /><br />other options are to smoke it (pure or sandwiched) or to plug it (insert analy)<br /><br />smoking is the best option for most people... but you should do your research on the difference in effect (each way of administration has a different effect/duration) and then see for yourself how you would like to use it. <br /><br />enjoy!

				I absolutely agree with the weed sandwich statement, but feel that cannabis takes away from the beauty of the experience, both subjectively during the experience and also the memory of the thing- which you will likely want a clear one of at some point, when you have a personal breakthrough experience (I&#039;m not talking about dosage as much as a special experience that was uniquely special; some are certainly more then others : D )<br /><br />If you tend to have paranoid and/or dyspohoric tendencies on ganja I&#039;d suggest leaving it out; then again you can always try it and how it works for you! use as small smount of herb as poss so you&#039;re able to easily do it all in one big hit (preferable)<br /><br />Check out DMT: The spirit molecule book or movie for in depth sceintific analyisis and genral DMT info!

				I managed to waste my dose in a vape last weekend. It wasn&#039;t until I read a bunch of threads on DMT for beginners did I find out how dead common that experience is. I did the weed sandwich thing and couldn&#039;t tell you exactly what went wrong. Temperature, possibly. I ended up trying a few.<br /><br />The vapour genie or glass vapour genie and torch is a highly recommended method for DMT. And there is the &quot;machine&quot; (search for it). Glass and torch seems most common.<br /><br />For vapes, though, the Volcano (surprise, surprise) comes away with the biggest rave reviews. Reading &quot;It&#039;s almost too easy&quot;, after my experience, made me want to go out and get one if it weren&#039;t for the ginormous price tag.<br />

Just barely enough green cannabis&nbsp; material to cover the DMT crystals. I Like Lucius said, when inhaling, don&#039;t let the fire touch any of the material. Let the fire heat the air above the top layer and let the air-ignited top layer vaporize your dmt, and yes, use as little greenage as possible.<br /><br />I find dmt harsh to smoke on its own, so I love having the familiar cannabis taste tell my body it&#039;s ok to inhale the stuff. I went out and bought a glass oil pipe but it was too easy to burn my product, the air was uncomfortably hot, and the straight dmt taste actually REALLY made my body react by wanting to exhale. It was not easy for me to smoke dmt with one of these pipes, so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be wasting my dmt in that thing anymore.

				Personally i use the GVG Sherlock, Vapour Genie torch lighter and a Volcano Liquid Pad cut down to size. Had some crazy crazy times with some of the DMT from SR. Some incredibly vivid and lucid interactions with entities of sorts, some of the most beautiful visuals, feelings of being connected to everything in existence and some things i just am not able to put into words!<br /><br />This is the only method i use therefore the only one i can recommend. It is an expensive option but the GVG Sherlock is a thing of beauty!

				The weed sandwich method of smoking DMT works, as long as you keep the flame above the weed and dont actually ignite it. You just want enough heat to vaporize the DMT.<br /><br /><br />Many people will buy special vaporizing pipes, such as the Glass VaporGenie specifically for DMT. They work great, but the GVG is just under $100<br /><br /><br />Another popular method is a homemade vaporizer called &quot;The Machine&quot;, involving a glass liquor bottle and some steel wool.<br /><br /><br />My personal favorite (even over &quot;The Machine&quot;) is using a crack pipe/stem with steel wool.<br />&nbsp;- Simply put a small bit of steel wool in the end of the stem, down to the little rim thats about 1&quot; from the end of the pipe. Heat the outside of the stem around the steel wool, then pour your pre-measured amount of DMT into the pipe and onto the steel wool. The heated steel wool will melt the DMT (but not vaporize it) and evenly distribute it on the steel wool fibers.<br />&nbsp;- Allow it to cool.<br />&nbsp;- When ready to smoke, just hold the lighter at the end of the pipe and inhale, but dont let the flame enter the tube, just hold it right on the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;outside and you will see all of your DMT vaporize! Its very easy to get 50 mg doses in one inhalation with this method. Now just hold the vapor for at least 15 seconds and blast off&nbsp; 8)

				as to be read in certain forums, there is a possibility of insufflation. <br /><br />tried it with freebase (ouch), tried with converted into dmt fumarates , and - no.&nbsp; it worked somehow with both substanced, but compared with what that amount of dmt (+- 100mg) would do once properly vaporized, i was really expecting something more! <br />i got in love with the idea of the 1h curve until back to basline, unfortunately the trip was never stronger then maybe from a decent acid tabto a half. regarding the long time it worked, it should somehow make the math again (at least i thought so), but in the end both experiences just felt like a solid loss of substance. the effects were really subtle, and not comparable to the greatness of dmt when consumed in a different way, at all. would not really suggest it, but since my expertise is limited to that handful of cases, i would be interested in other reviews to that road of administration!<br /><br /><br />otherwise i like my dmt in my gvg.&nbsp; when smoking with friends, eg outside on a landscape, a changa joint can be a great tool, too. not the most effective way, neither, but makes up for a awesome group experience.<br />read a comment just 1-2 weeks before on a forum, where someone praised his volcano vape even over his gvg, and said, that the comfortabilty of the balloon is the thing for him to launch hyperspace. 3 hits on the bag, no lighter, nothing to really hande with, and he&#039;s gone ..... even if a bit loss is integrated (due to possible condensation on the bag), that might be a nice RoA as well. seems easy to handle and possibly to blow you up, too. might make out great for a group experience with 1-2 friends.<br />gonna get out my extreme-q and fill up that balloon, soon ... =)

				Go to your local oriental store ... with a bit of luck you&#039;ll find the harmala seeds there because e.g. in Morocco iirc and other countries of northern Africa it is used as a (holy) spice for some meals -- not to mention it&#039;s much cheaper there as if you buy it in a entheogenic-bla-something shop in the web or elsewhere ;-&gt;

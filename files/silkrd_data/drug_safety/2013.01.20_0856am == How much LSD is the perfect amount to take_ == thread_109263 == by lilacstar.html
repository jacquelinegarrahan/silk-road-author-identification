				I&#039;m wondering what dose you guys take when you want to trip super hard, but don&#039;t want to be completely gone.<br /><br />Also what is the most you ever took, and what was that experience like?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking because the only doses I ever took is 100ug and 250ug at different times. The 100ug I didn&#039;t get any visuals but it was still awesome with the whole mind part. The 250ug I got fractals and patterns moving and everything waving and awesome closed eye visuals as well as brighter colors and very mild shadow hallucinations. But I wasn&#039;t tripping a whole lot, as I could still have normal conversations with people and they wouldn&#039;t notice I was on anything unless they looked at my saucer pupils.<br /><br />I would love to double, or even triple my highest normal dose to get insane visuals and hallucinations. But at the same time, I don&#039;t want to take too much that I&#039;d end up thinking I&#039;m &quot;a glass of orange juice&quot;. I still want to be safe but trip hard.<br /><br />What is the perfect dose for you guys?

				The effects of LSD are very subjective and it really hits people in different ways. For me, I would be absolutely tripping balls on somewhere between 120ug - 150ug. At that dose, I would find it very hard to hide that I was twisted on some drug or other. Acid heads would know a mile away what I was up to :)<br /><br />The biggest dose I have taken was about 300ug and I was properly hallucinating. It was an incredible experience - I spent about 3 hours meditating during the trip and I felt like I had been reborn after I came down from the trip. I don&#039;t really want to start taking higher doses. Simple reason being that I don&#039;t want LSD to lose it s magic for me and I don&#039;t want to build a crazy high tolerance, like I have done with MDMA. I keep my trips few and far between and I always have a blast.<br /><br />In your case, you should try pushing the boundaries with higher doses if that&#039;s what you feel is right. Just remember, there is only so high you can go and if you keep taking higher doses to get to a higher place, it could back fire with incredibly high tolerance...that would suck, in my opinion as the magic would be lost.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Maid Mandy

				i m looking for that perfect dose too....<br />every time i dose i just feel like something is missing from the trip. the first few hours are fun but&nbsp; i always&nbsp; wish i took more....<br />maybe dropping something on it would be a good idea.... eat your normal dose and drop something that has a nice synergy with it...

I&#039;d usually take ~150mg of MDMA a couple of hours after I take my trip. Usually works well for me :)

				I would definitely agree with the posts above me.&nbsp; keep in mind that psychedelics amplify each other&#039;s effects and since MDMA is a mild psychedelic kandy flipping is intense.&nbsp; So is hippy flippy(MDMA and shrooms).&nbsp; Vitamin C will also boost the effects of your fry a little bit.&nbsp; I&#039;d say it&#039;d almost be worth keeping your same dose for lsd, but supplementing with some MDMA at a couple-few times in the trip.

				How much LSD is riight for serious trip varies greatly and the only real way to find your own sweet spot is trial and error.<br /><br />Keep in mind though that LSD strength by many vendors are hugely exaggerated, so unless you bought from a tested vendor your 250ug dosis could well have been considerably less.<br /><br />Personally I take 300 - 400ug for a serious tripping experience. That is tested LSD from a recognized vendor though. See the avengers thread: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />I would not go near +400ug doses without an experienced trip sitter I totally trust making sure I don&#039;t get into trouble. Have tried a few times and it was scary at times - not bad but it definitely put me in a zone where events were well beyond my control.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d also agree that anything more than 2 tabs, if you&#039;re gonna be in public, you should probably bring a trip sitter.

				I usually take 1 hit, whatever dosage that may be from the batch I get it from.&nbsp; I have been getting pretty consistently dosed papers these past couple years, between 80-120ug per tab.&nbsp; They have been vouched for enough times by enough highly-experienced users that I trust the findings without actually going and getting the papers tested myself.&nbsp; (When I first was introduced to L, I made some friends who were really heavy in the 60s psychedelic scene, and never got out of it, so I look to them for advice I can trust--I gotta think that tripping every few months for 50 years, and never losing a connection to L--that they can judge potency pretty accurately.&nbsp; I mean I&#039;ve been using LSD for 10 years and I think I have a pretty good grasp of dosages, assuming that my conservative baseline estimates are about correct)&nbsp; But I&#039;m not going to get any further into that point--that&#039;s a whole different topic<br /><br />So for me, 80ug is usually enough to party.&nbsp; 150ug (~2 hits) is enough to get me tripping out.&nbsp; 240ug is enough to get me melting and swirling.&nbsp; And then there are the monster trips...my first monster I ever took was 7 hits of ~100ug tabs, which sent me into space for a good 48 hours.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about swimming in the clouds, laughing at grass, licking the wind, and touching anything and everything because it just feels so nice!<br /><br />I&#039;ve only tripped like that twice--once with paper, and another time with freshly mixed liquid.&nbsp; both trips were about the same dosage.&nbsp; I absolutely loved the high dose trips, but that&#039;s probably because my set and setting were completely optimal (weekend long music festivals on a private farm outside of a small, rural, Pennsylvania town, with close friends, female companionship, good music of all different kinds, and a high degree of freedom from law enforcement (cops were there, but they were only concerned with keeping the peace, not with busting people for using or selling drugs).&nbsp; I have wanted to take another monster trip for a long time, but I simply haven&#039;t been in another situation where the set and setting were so perfect for doing that.&nbsp; <br /><br />So yeah, for me, 1/2/3 hits are my typical domain of dosages, and of all the times I take 1/2/3 hits, I probably take 1 hit like 90% of the time.&nbsp; Once you know how LSD works, you don&#039;t need a monster dose to get a monster trip.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty trained at this point to make whatever I want to of my trip, as long as I have some minimum amount of ug in me, and the hits I&#039;ve been getting lately have been good enough for just 1 hit to get me there.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				I did 500ug my first time because I really didn&#039;t understand what that meant. Now I feel like if I take less than that it&#039;s going to be underwhelming, and LSD is ridiculously hard to find so I don&#039;t really ever see myself testing that hypothesis.

				Blackend: You don&#039;t have to worry about that. Honestly you&#039;ll have a great time.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend ~200ug.&nbsp; And LSD is EXTREMELY easy to get on here.

				200ug to 400ug is the ideal amount if want to experience the full spectrum of psychedelic effects, up to and including a spiritual experience (by which I mean so-called &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot; or Satori-Samadhi levels of consciousness - a sense of complete unity with everything in the universe, which is the highest state of bliss).<br /><br />100ug can sometimes evoke a spiritual experience, but it will usually only last momentarily at the peak of the trip. At 200-400ug, it can last almost the entire duration of the trip, and it is more intense as well.<br /><br />If I take anything less than 200ug, I feel I haven&#039;t taken enough.<br /><br />200-400ug was also the dosage used in LSD psychotherapy in the 1960s.

Very interesting! :) Also, agreed on all points. Anything below 200ug just doesn&#039;t feel appropriate, as the effects do not seem to fully manifest themselves at such a dosage. I typically try to aim for ~400ug, but I sway from 200-600ug.

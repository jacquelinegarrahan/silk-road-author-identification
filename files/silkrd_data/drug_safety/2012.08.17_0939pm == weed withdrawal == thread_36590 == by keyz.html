				There is a possibility of having cannabis withdrawals, but he could be saying that just so he can smoke some of your shit. <br /><br />The time course and significance of cannabis withdrawal: <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12943018<br /><br />sdesu

				From what I&#039;ve read there are no withdrawal symptoms from weed, I don&#039;t even think you can get physically addicted but mentally you can. I have a friend that smokes before bed and now they swear they can&#039;t go to sleep without smoking first.

				I&#039;m kinda divided on this issue I used to think it was stupid as hell to say that you could withdrawal from weed... but I&#039;ve smoked everyday for years and a month or so ago I stopped for about a week or so, and during that week I had ridiculous insomnia, like I could not fall asleep to save my life I probably ran on 1-2 hours a night for several days and I could not think of anything that would have caused it except not smoking weed. I don&#039;t know if that would be mental or physical though. So now I&#039;m thinking that insomnia is a possible symptom of withdrawal from weed, but my bf laughs at me when I bring it up b/c he thinks it is impossible.

				When I was a heavy smoker if I didn&#039;t smoke I would be sick and unable to eat for a week. Very unpleasant physical w/d. This doesn&#039;t happen everyone from what I read but for me it was as bad as heroin.

				Cannabis withdrawl, even for a VERY heavy user, is factually and measurably less than caffeine withdraw.&nbsp; Meaning, a true stoner Jones less than someone who needs a cup of coffee. <br /><br />

				I smoked weed for 10 years and quit no problem. I was on a lot of opies though.. it&#039;s good to not be hungry 24 fucking 7. Does weed speed up metabolism? Even though I eat less I think I&#039;ve gained weight since quitting.

				A lot of that could be just the mental idea he THOUGHT he was addicted to weed and subconsciously makes up symptoms. Basically a hypochondriac

As previously stated sleeping is very hard indeed if you are accustomed to a nice bedsies joint before sleep, but once asleep I was often woken by the intense dreams I was having. It is enjoyable to have those kind of dreams once more but actually in the end just kept me awake. I believe this is because when smoking regularly I never tend to dream and rather just drift off into nothingness, without meaning to sound too bleak. <br /><br />Apart from that I did not really notice any physical withdrawels, only mental (just wanting to get blazed&nbsp; ;D )

Your brain got used to &#039;being slightly numb&#039; during REM phases. What you experience are very likely just regular dreams again or some sort of overcompensation, should be gone in 1-2 weeks max. <br /><br /><br />Lots of misinformation here :&#039;( You can get addicted psychologically to pretty much everything. People even get &#039;addicted&#039; to collecting trash, turning the light switch on and off 50 times or eating chocolate or gummy bears. <br /><br /><br />As for the withdrawals, you won&#039;t experience &#039;real&#039; withdrawals as you would when quitting alcohol, benzos, heroin or meth. But your body got used to the daily intake of a substance and it needs to readjust. So saying one can just stop without noticing anything is just not correct for most people. I quit smoking like 5 years ago, was at 40/day and I quit cold turkey. I was completely fucked up for a month. I had frequent headaches, couldn&#039;t concentrate at all, experienced perceptual distortions, couldn&#039;t sleep (lot&#039;s of psych related stuff mixed in there I guess). <br /><br /><br />Friend of mine quit weed just a year before he finished university. Smoked about 10 years straight, pretty much every day. the last 7-8 only homegrown weed and only bong. He had quite some farm, but he smoked it all himself. I couldn&#039;t even keep up with him for one day. When he quit he got physically sick, he was/is always an extremely fit guy, looked like the worst flu ever. Two weeks later it was gone. <br />Most amazing thing: He finished university (not saying how far he went) in a field that&#039;s pretty much the opposite of easy. summa cum laude. I still think he was more engaged on weed then without. lol.

				After my first year of college one of my friends came up to school (hes from LA, our uni is not in LA)<br />and apparently our uni town was totally dry, so he sends me a message out of no where <br />&quot;Yo dawg, where da weed at. I think I&#039;m going through withdrawls, my balls are itching something fierce.&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br />So now I&#039;m interested, anyone else have this particular symptom?

Then I run out of weed but the habit of not eating more than a little every day continues, and suddenly feeling it is very unpleasant.

I&#039;ve noticed the withdrawals I feel are far less now that I only vaporize.&nbsp; It screws with your sleeping: Cannabis does a really good job at releasing melatonin from within the brain.&nbsp; If your accustomed to toking before bed your body is used to having this substance release melatonin, when you quit your body/mind will have to re-adjust back to producing melatonin naturally.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can beat the insomnia aspect of it right off the bat tho. It helps if you can get on a airplane early in the morning and fly halfway around the globe- I thought I would have troubles sleeping then but I was able to go sleep normally every nite.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

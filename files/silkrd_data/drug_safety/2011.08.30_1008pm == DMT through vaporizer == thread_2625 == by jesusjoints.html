				I would think that an automatic vaporizer (push button/self ignition) would get too hot. These are generally designed to vaporize cannabis.&nbsp; The melting point of freebase D is significantly lower. I&#039;ve tried a lot of methods and I&#039;ve found that a homemade DMT machine is the way to go.&nbsp; It is a smoother and cleaner smoke than anything else I&#039;ve tried.

				I too have the Arizer Extreme Q but i decided not to use it for smoking DMT because i read online that DMT leaves a nasty smell in ur vaporizer (dont wanna ruin my vaporizer now do i ?)<br /><br />I use my faithful glass pipe to do it, put some ash in the bowl, put in my DMT and cover it in a layer of MJ. I then burn my weed (very slowly), which then heats the DMT. This method seems to work fine..

Vaporized cannabis emits a thin gray vapor, whereas combusted<br />cannabis produces a thick smoke. Thus, vaporizers deliver a better cannabinoid-<br />to-tar ratio than cigarettes or water pipes (Gieringer 1996). In a recent<br />study, traces of THC were vaporized at temperatures as low as 140°C (284°F)<br />and the majority of THC vaporized by 185°C (365°F); benzene and other carcinogenic<br />vapors did not appear until 200°C (392°F), and cannabis combustion<br />occurred around 230°C (446°F)&quot;. ~ (Gieringer 2001).<br /><br />another awesome vaporizer i&#039;d suggest for controlled temp is the Launch Box. I&#039;d carry that as well as the ubie but it&#039;s too much money.<br /><br /><br /><br />L75

				i wonder what I&#039;d have more control of.. a 200 dollar<br />device that has heat sensors or a piece of 10 dollar glass<br />with a lighter over it..<br />also I&#039;ve used a Launch Box and they are pretty shitty lol.

				Sorry for going OT BUT the launch box is not &#039;shitty&#039;. If you haven&#039;t spent the time to get over the learning curve, don&#039;t judge it. I&#039;ve had that thing since near the beginning and it&#039;s awesome for what it is. A vape you can use literally ANYWHERE, just gotta make sure you don&#039;t have crappy batteries/charger. They also came out with the AC power adapter and that surpasses using the batteries in every way. You can also order the car dc adapter and that&#039;s pretty much all you need.<br /><br />BUT the launch box isn&#039;t comparable to how much vapor you can get using full desktop units, such as the extreme q, ssv, or da buddha. I have the extreme q and am EXTREMELY satisfied with it, there&#039;s just a tiny mod you need to do for the bowl.<br /><br />Still waiting on my dmt that I ordered last week, expecting it today. Excited&nbsp; ;).

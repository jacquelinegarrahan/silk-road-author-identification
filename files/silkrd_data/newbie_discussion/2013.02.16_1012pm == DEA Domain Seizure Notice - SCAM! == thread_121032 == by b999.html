				I logged in and got a DEA domain seizure notice.&nbsp; I just tried logging in again and I hope I didn&#039;t go to a scam site and give up my password... desperately trying to get in to SR via http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php now which just keeps timing out, so I can change my PIN in case I just hit a scam URL instead.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember what the other one was.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />(edit - now realised I was scammed - hoping I caught it in time!!)

				memorize the SR site URL.&nbsp; Onion sites are easily copyed because it&#039;s just a jumble of letters and numbers.

				If I can find the phishing URL again I&#039;ll post it up, because I&#039;m pretty sure I got scammed.&nbsp; Well I&#039;m an idiot, and I won&#039;t make that mistake again.&nbsp; However, I am still hopeful.<br /><br />Upon getting in to SR, after madly bashing at refresh for half an hour or so, I got in and immediately changed my PIN and password.&nbsp; However my balance was zero (panic), but then saw nothing in account history (cautious relief).&nbsp; The deposit is definitely confirmed in Blockchain though, so it went somewhere.&nbsp; Even so I sent the funds through about 8 hours ago so I&#039;m a bit nervous that it&#039;s not showing up yet.<br /><br />Is it possible to wipe tracks from account history?&nbsp; I desperately hope not, and that I got in and changed my password and PIN before the scammers got in, and before the funds had been processed in SR.<br /><br />Can it take 8 hours or more for funds to appear?<br /><br />I have sent a message to SR support even so, with deposit transaction details.<br /><br />This is my first attempt at SR and I feel like a total fool for falling for that, you&#039;d think I&#039;d know better.<br /><br />Basically a warning to all, Silk Road DOES NOT ASK FOR YOUR PIN ON LOG-IN.

				I&#039;m also cautiously hopeful because I could still log in ok, I would have thought that a scammer would also immediately change the PIN and password to lock me out.<br /><br />So:<br /><br />1) Can transaction history be wiped from SR account page?<br />2) Can it take more than 8 hours for a deposit to appear following a successful BC transaction?<br /><br />I&#039;m also cautiously hopeful after I looked at my stats...<br /><br />Total transactions: 0<br />Total spent: ฿0<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br /><br />I know there are some delays in the SR system (there is a notice that withdrawals are taking up to 12 hours) so perhaps I was just lucky that my act of embarrassing stupidity fell was saved by an overloaded system that hadn&#039;t caught up yet.<br /><br />The transfer from my BC wallet to SR definitely went through though.&nbsp; It just hasn&#039;t appeared on SR yet.<br /><br />As a precaution if this gets resolved should I close my existing account and open a completely new one? Or is changing PIN and password sufficient?

				Oh no, that sucks. Yes rule of thumb, memorize the url (the very big 5 inch pizza idea is genius). But NEVER enter your pin on login. There were a few fake SR URLs in wikipedia a while back and a lot of people entered their pin etc. assuming it was a SR change. They got their accounts cleared out by scammers.<br /><br />My rule is never to do anything on SR in a blind panic to buy drugs. When the SR quick buy scam was going on I very nearly fell for it as hasn&#039;t been on the site for a month. I figured it was a new feature. But as shipping had been disabled I asked my usual dealer if i could send the coins to his account and DM him the order and mailing address etc. in a priv note. He said yes. By then I was shredded and didn&#039;t double check his user name spelling. Someone had made an account with a very similar name with a space in the middle. I transferred the coins to that account, but THANK F-CK SR Support very, very brilliantly was able to help and get my money back. I will always heart DPR for that as he could have said &#039;tough luck buddy&#039;. <br /><br />So NEVER do anything that seems untoward and if in doubt consult the forums first. Better to wait a day and get your order and not lose money than panic order and loose your money because of a scammer.<br /><br />&nbsp;Fingers crossed you get your money, buddy.

				thanks for the support, I&#039;m still hopeful that I caught it in time.&nbsp; I banged on refresh on the correct URL as soon as I realised what an idiot I was, and as soon as I got in I changed my password.&nbsp; Yeah it must have been on a wiki site or something.&nbsp; Perhaps I could get back in before they did as SR was timing out for a while.&nbsp; I&#039;m also hopeful the little parasites don&#039;t immediately try to get in thinking the DEA warning notice would turn people off.<br /><br />Parasites like that should be taken out and shot, they infect society like a disease.&nbsp; Even so, I know it&#039;s my own fault for being an idiot.<br /><br />There is still nothing in account history, and balance is zero.<br /><br />Hoping......<br /><br />How long has it taken you to get your deposits through, at worst, and this weekend?

				What I would do is act as if the money&#039;s gone put it down to experience and be careful in future and secretly hope that you&#039;re lucky and the money shows up in the next couple of days. SR deposits can take as long as eight hours especially as there&#039;s just been a site roll back. Wait and see what SR Support says- you could well have got in before the scammers, I&#039;m not tech-savvy enough to know how a scam like that works. I also don&#039;t know how or why your account history would have been cleared. But had they transferred money out before you got there could they have cleared your history so they left no trail as to where it went? I don&#039;t want to scare you but that&#039;s just a thought. The fact your password&#039;s not been changed is a good sign though. The little shits. <br /><br />Here&#039;s an article with the PIN no scan outlined which I&#039;ve copy/pasted below. <br /><br />Good Luck! <br /><br />http://allthingsvice.com/2013/01/23/whos-got-it-in-for-the-silk-road/<br /><br />&quot;Wiki phishing<br /><br />A more successful scam has involved someone changing the URL for Silk Road in the Wikipedia entry. It looked enough like the real URL to fool many people. Entering that URL into the<br />Tor browser brought the user to a login page that looked just like Silk Road’s page, except it requested the user’s PIN (which the legitimate site does not require) as well as their password.<br /><br />Users who fell for the scam had their passwords changed and their accounts cleared out. Several members claimed to have lost thousands of dollars worth of coin.<br /><br />One vendor also had his forum account hacked, with the scammer posting as the vendor, stating he had been busted. The trusted vendor requested help from the community to fund his defence. Several members transferred a total of $600 worth of Bitcoin to the scammer before the vendor was able to regain control of his forum account and reveal what happened.<br /><br />Wikipedia no longer provides the URL to the website.&quot;<br /><br />

				Thanks... looks like standard practice is to change the password to lock the user out... Is it possible to erase account history though? There is no record of any funds having moved through the account at all, and I got in just fine once SR came back up.&nbsp; It&#039;s looking more likely that they sit there harvesting and go in infrequently hoping the DEA notice scares people off from trying to get in to their account.<br /><br />However it&#039;s been almost 12 hours since I initiated the transfer from my BC wallet so here&#039;s hoping I&#039;ll be ok.<br /><br />Lesson learned either way, not to be an idiot like that again.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what I was thinking.&nbsp; But there&#039;s no excuse to fall for a scam like that.<br /><br />It would be good to see Silk Road put some sort of identity verification system on their website, to verify THEIR identity.&nbsp; Some sort of scam URL list may help too.&nbsp; Either way if anyone feels like going nuclear on a PARAsite (which is a better label than &#039;phishing site&#039;) the URL is HERE:<br /><br />http://silkroadv5p5cbl6.onion<br /><br />MF&#039;ers, I hope they rot in hell, even if I am ok and it&#039;s just a delay, I hope the world unites on a DOS attack on this site or something.&nbsp; Take the f&#039;ers down.&nbsp; Or feed in so much gibberish it makes it increasingly difficult for the parasitic little worms to get anything useful out of it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post this up in a separate warning thread too and message SR support in case they want to put up a warning somewhere or something.

				Yes good idea to let the admins know. I would have fallen for it had I not known about it, SR can be a confusing place. I didn&#039;t buy for a god few weeks before scrolling through the forums as even though the pictures of the drugs were calling my name I was worried I&#039;d screw up my personal security and that&#039;s far more important than losing cash as horrid as that may be. xx

				&nbsp;:-[<br /><br />Still no sign of the cash...&nbsp; Been around 13 hours now.&nbsp; I&#039;m still hopeful because of the message on the help site that withdrawals are taking 13 or more hours to go through, and that they will catch up &#039;in the next few hours&#039;, so perhaps my deposit is just caught up in that somehow.&nbsp; And that I could log in ok suggests they hadn&#039;t got in first.<br /><br />And, nothing showing up in account history.<br /><br />I messaged support with the details anyway... hoping I just caught SR on a bad weekend.<br /><br />How&#039;s everyone else&#039;s deposits going?&nbsp; Has anyone else had any delays getting deposits through this weekend?

				Can&#039;t remember, possibly a Wiki or something.&nbsp; I just remember I searched StartPage and it one of the top links.<br /><br />Does anyone know if I had been hacked if it should show up in my account history (transfer), and if it is possible for a deposit to take 15 or so hours to show up?

				In my experience, yes transfers do show up in your account history.&nbsp; &nbsp;While it is possible for a deposit to take 15 hours or more, it&#039;s rare.&nbsp; Have you contacted support through the main site?&nbsp; Maybe they can help.

				Yep, transfer went through ok to the receiver wallet then 15 minutes later to two other addresses in turn, final balance zero.&nbsp; Checked on the blockchain website.<br /><br />I have messaged security although it sounds like they have their hands full at the moment.<br /><br />Been almost 15 hours now.

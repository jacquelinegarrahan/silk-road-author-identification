				DRshrooms- His DMT, to put it simply is AMAZING! Both n,n(white) and n-oxide(yellow). It does not disappoint. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His changa, like everything else that the DR does, is done to the highest standard. You can&#039;t go wrong with DRshrooms! Another<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; easy 5/5. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication is also 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping speed and stealth are always fast, a 5/5 too.<br /><br />NaturalWeed- Ordered some of his standard hash peace shit pollen which I enjoyed. Nice relaxing comes from smoking this. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His PENG POLLUM Pollen Shit Hash Peace Dope BEST is very good. A light color, and it breaks apart easily and nicely. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could smoke this again and again... 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Customer service and communication from the little communication we had was 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipping speed and stealth are a 5/5 too.<br /><br />NewTime- His DMT, n,n is also AMAZING! Brings a positive handwritten message which I found to be a very nice and uplifting thought!5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication are a 5/5. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping speed and stealth are also a 5/5.<br /><br />The Scurvy Crew- Their Ketama hash was excellent. Mixed with my regular bud in a blunt would make the blunt last twice as long because <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could turn it off half way, or smoke the whole thing and be twice as high. Decisions, decisions...&nbsp; ;D A 5/5 from me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their Pakistan pollen plaque is very good too. Weight was over on both. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried their Algerian and of course I was not disappointed. It was soft and smoked great. I found it to have a sweet <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;taste. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication was excellent! Also a 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping speed and stealth a 5/5 too.<br /><br />LexieSadie- I just tried her Afghan Kush Earwax and it is FIRE! Strong smell, I like the taste and the buzz is strong. Vapes like a champ. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ordered her 2 Grams of Wax Great for Dabs and once again what I received was FIRE! Not quite as dank as the earwax but<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;very, very close. A pleasure to vaporize. Another 5/5 for Lexie.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Excellent customer service gets a 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipping speed and stealth an easy 5/5 (arrived quickly)<br /><br />MendoHashMan- Ordered a gram of his BHO and I am glad that I did. The oil is just as he describes, THICK, which is really nice to vape.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It smells good and I think it tastes even better. Definitely a 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication was stellar. Another 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping was FAST and stealth was one of the best I&#039;ve seen. 5/5<br /><br />xinhai- The 1 gram oil shooter comes in a no needle syringe which I am new to but so far so good. It is very aromatic, and is nice and THICK. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No problem with this in the vaporizer, it vapes fast and hits hard. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His Caviar is nice and STRONG smoke. Great cerebral/body mix to it, feel nicely medicated but not couch locked. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication are a 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipping and stealth were excellent. 5/5<br /><br />MMM- Placed an order for his White Widow Organic- Medical Grade- AAA- bud and was not disappointed. I know of no local production of this<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strain so I placed an order with MMM and what I got was some very high quality white widow. Product gets a 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication are a 5/5 too.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping and stealth is best I have seen so far. 5/5.<br /><br />emerald- Bought his Royal Afgani. Premium nº1 Hash and boy am I glad that I gave it a try. This stuff is light, and when a little heat is applied <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to it it breaks up wonderfully. I like mixing it with my bud an rolling it in a paper, it burns forever like this, awesome! Blunts are okay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but I find that they burn quicker. Ordered 5 grams, received 5.7 grams. Product quality an easy 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Customer service and communication a 5/5 too.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipping and stealth was good. A 5/5.<br /><br />mahakala- My first experience with changa and it was wonderful. I found that it eases me into hyperspace rather than blasting me off like <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when I smoke DMT freebase, but I am a great fan of the spirit molecule in all its forms. 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Customer service and communication are a 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipping and stealth was BEAUTIFUL! 5/5.<br /><br />FractalBliss- Ordered his n,n DMT which has a little bit of a very light yellow tinge to it. The product is amazing. It delivers the &quot;hyperspace&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; experience. 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication are 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping was FAST! and stealth was excellent, 5/5.<br /><br />DeemzBeemz- Ordered his n,n DMT, looks nice and white. This DMT is AMAZING too! Some of the strongest I have had the pleasure of <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; coming across. An EASY 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication are 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipment and delivery were FAST! and stealth was excellent, 5/5.<br /><br />anonymart- 5 grams of white widow kief that is FIRE! A nice additive to add to any smoke; bowl, join, blunt. A 5/5. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Customer service and communication are 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipment and delivery were fast and stealth was good. 5/5.<br /><br />SolidRain- Tried his delicious DayWrecker lollipops and was not disappointed. Nice and strong. 5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Customer service and communication, 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shipment and delivery were fast and stealth was good. A 5/5.<br /><br />mushroomgirl- Her mushrooms are STRONG! I ordered a 7, received 7.6. =) I took 1.4 to test and I am glad that I did because that dose was<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sufficient to produce what I would consider a strong reaction that was very pleasant. A definite 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer service and communication a 5/5.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipment and delivery were fast and stealth was excellent. 5/5.<br /><br />Good vendors with good products. <br /><br />Long live The Silk Road and the Dread Pirate Roberts!

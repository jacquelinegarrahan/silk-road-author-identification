				Awesome. I was just getting ready to list Northwest Nuggets as another excellent vendor. Very friendly and fast shipping. I ordered a 1/2 oz split between his Space Queen, Northern Lights, and Recon. All three are really, really dank (covered in trichs with a stellar cure). Recommended.

				I don&#039;t think there is too much of a comparison between the two. NW Nugz is more of a bulk vendor. Northwest Nuggets is a smaller batch operation. In other words,&nbsp; Northwest Nuggets for my headstash, but if I was selling ounces/qps, I&#039;d go with NW Nugz.

				This is my review for a half ounce of sour diesel from PrivateReserve<br /><br />Weight: 4/5 A LITTLE underweight but quality over quantity <br /><br />Smell: 5/5 I put this stuff in my backpack and everywhere i went started to smell like sour diesel<br /><br />Quality: 5/5 Covered in orange hairs and is insanely frosty<br /><br />Effect: 5/5 Smoked too much and threw up (first time ever) but when I first smoked the effect was great, amazing head high<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5 everything was perfect besides it being underweight :) A+++++

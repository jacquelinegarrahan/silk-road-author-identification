				Most of the people that come here either cant get a certain thing or they dont want to go out on the street and take a big chance. Everything here is anonymous and a lot of us take a big risk sending packages. I understand some prices are high but I believe your paying for the risk and to be anonymous.

				I tend to stick to psychedelics and I have found the prices to be generally fair. SR is offering a service which offers protection from some issues generally related to purchasing drugs. It does however add the difficulty of receiving things in the mail, especially if they are coming from another country. <br /><br />IMO weed cost way too damn much.Luckily, it is easy to get elsewhere without much risk.

				There are some important factors to consider here:<br /><br />#1 - You are paying a premium for seller risk, reliability, consumer safety, and convenience.<br />#2 - Demand is rising in SR since the media spike with the number of vendors being quite disproportionate.<br />#3 - What are the purity levels in your area? It wouldn&#039;t be a fair comparison if the stuff you get is cut.

				It seems the only deals on SR are benzo&#039;s. I was excited to be a part of SR but I would be lying if I said I wasn&#039;t bummed out by the prices. Like another poster said, we are paying for convenience, but is convenience worth twice street prices? I reckon so. I&#039;m the last to bitch about it, I&#039;m just glad we even are able to use a site like this in our time. Maybe when I win the lottery I&#039;ll shop specifically on SR lol. In the mean time I&#039;ll drool over the great products for sale and hope as the years carry on the prices dip. Cheers to you all!

				Prices are indeed a bit high. <br /><br />But you have to count in: the SR fee, shipping costs, time spent preparing packages/answering messages/etc, a vendor that will loose a certain percentage when cashing out his bitcoins, the chance of scamming, etc.<br /><br />Acid prices are OK for 100 hits, which you can get for around 4.5 tot 5€ a piece here. I used to be able to buy the same tabs IRL for about €3.5 tot €4 so there is offcourse a mark-up.

				Its simple economics: A product is worth what you can get for it. If people buy products at high prices, no one is going to offer them for cheaper.<br /><br />Why do people buy at high prices? Convenience, security, inability to find another source etc.

				So far my experience has been that it is actually cheaper. I&#039;ve been careful to only go with reputable vendors and only after i&#039;ve read lots of reviews. <br />The coke is expensive, but i&#039;d rather pay a high price for something good than the usual street price for something that has little or no coke in it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought LSD, MDMA and Coke from SR - not been dissapointed yet. Just do your research before buying anything.

				Because 1. They can<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. We pay it<br /><br />Becoming a weed vendor is very tempting. You could sell oz for 20 btc and still make a profit. The prob is that people would order off you and then sell it, probably split up for even more, either in RL or SR. This is the exact attitude that has seen prices rise, quality and quantity decline. I think it is also true outside of SR and all things fun and illegal.<br />On the flip side of the coin SR is a freakin candy shop of delights, all available through your letterbox!!!!

				the prices can get high when the bitcoin values drop and your money in the account decreases.&nbsp; also, it depends on what you&#039;re getting.&nbsp; prices are quite fair for psychedelics.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know much about weed but it seems like the prices are also quite reasonable.&nbsp; however, the numbers for the hard stuff like coke, heroin, and meth are astronomically high - probably due to the risk involved.

				Shipping some of the bulkier things properly adds to the trouble/expense for sellers. I&#039;d guess much of it is supply vs demand. Where there is demand, tho, supply will follow.

				I think a lot of people get it in their head that just because they are buying off of the internet the drugs are mythically going to be sooo much better. That&#039;s not true, the vendors are just like regular dealers that you have locally, they get their product from the higher ups and sell it to us, the consumers, just because it&#039;s bought online does not make it better. And just because it&#039;s sold for a higher price does not make it better. Vendors do a great job advertising on here and making you believe that their gear is the be all of drugs. <br /><br />So yes, certain products are great to buy here if you are unable to find them locally or do not have a regular contact for such a product, but you can get scammed here just as you can get scammed in the real. And please, nobody is getting stabbed left right and center buying drugs.<br /><br />And certain products on here are ridiculously over priced no matter how pure the gear is. Fact.

				The herb prices can not be beat where I live, its mostly brick bud that sells for 80 oz or 250 a QP. When people see any sort of &quot;Nug&quot; its 50$ or more instantly a8th. If its really good prices can demand upwards of 100 a 1/8th. The E prices seem a Little high we were getting them for 4 dollars a pill locally if we bought 1k or more worth. Coke is high but I dono what the quality is like I have done it here and in Miami before, so I have both ends of the spectrum. Only thing about Miami was in order to get the good shit you had to go into Liberty City :o.

				Someone said it well earlier -&quot; You&#039;re paying for the service as well as the drugs&quot;<br /><br />Seriously, you stay in your house or where ever your grabbing wi-fi and you search for what want and identify a reputable seller after that it&#039;s a few clicks and it&#039;s delivered to your door. <br /><br />Take into consideration security, the hardware infrastructure, the fact that when a seller puts your order &quot;intransit&quot; your address is erased so if you use PGP you&#039;ll provide an added layer of security. all the resources working the Resolution Center, Moderators on the Forums, backend system admninstors, etc.. The SR sellers now need to put our money upfront, be creative &amp; stealth with our shipping materials which adds up and come up with different methods for repeat buyers, we get burned by the occasional scammers, there&#039;s a fair amount of reasons why the price here is higher than on the street and you get to use &quot;escrow&quot;

				Prices seem &quot;high&quot; because of the non-local nature of the market.. For example, guys in Texas are used to super duper bargains on cocaine because of their proximity to the Mexican border, Britain on the other hand (along with much of the world) is not so fortunate... so why would vendors sell blow for 40 bucks a gram when they know most people will pay 100 a gram? <br />Like I said, if you&#039;re local market is better go frequent your local market for those goods.. and maybe read up on your capitalism

				It really depends on the drug in question for me. For instance:<br /><br />Cannabis = much more expensive here for the same excellent quality.<br />LSD = equal in price but better quality. I&#039;d say if there&#039;s one drug that&#039;s cheaper on SR, it&#039;s LSD.<br />Cocaine/Heroin= No idea where to get them here, so SR is the only option if I wanted them.<br /><br />But for the question at hand, it&#039;s simple. SR is generally more expensive because 1) You pay for shipping :p, 2) There&#039;s more risk involved to the seller, especially when you&#039;re sending drugs to random people through the mail, and 3) The drugs are usually of much higher quality here.

				I think very much so that not only is it the service and quality you pay for but remember for example.<br />Let&#039;s say st level gear is 15% and you&#039;re paying $100.<br />Street level gear is supplied to your st dealer in 8 balls, the 8 ball seller is supplied by the ounce, the ounce seller is supplied by the pound, the pound seller is supplied by the cook.That&#039;s 4 or 5 people cutting it before you even get to sniff it. If they&#039;re all jumping 50% (adding 50 grams of cutter to 100 grams), then you&#039;re only getting a 15% ish purity. At $100 a gram.<br />here there seem to be a few sellers who are either cooking themselves or being supplied from the cooks. So you&#039;re looking at either very close to 100% purity or 66.6% purity (assuming a 50% cut). <br />Now for example let&#039;s say here it&#039;s DOUBLE the price (omfg the horror right?!)... I&#039;d much rather pay $200 a gram for 66% purity than 4100 a gram for 15% st level crap

				There are a lot of cuts that get taken out of the money before it gets back to the vendor which is why the prices are *high*<br /><br />take into consideration the fees that get taken out along the way before the money goes to the venor<br />A fee to convert cash to bitcoins<br />A fee to tumble bitcoins<br />A fee to SR for facilitating the transaction<br />A fee to tumble the bitcoins <br />A fee to cash out the bitcoins<br />A fee to launder the cash <br /><br />Only the last fee applies to IRL dealers. <br />I&#039;m not a vendor but i&#039;m guessing that close to 50% of the buyer&#039;s money actually ends up with the vendor.

				I actually think prices are reasonable, though there is a &quot;least common denominator&quot; effect - I can get an oz of weed for under $200 where I&#039;m from, but in New York it&#039;s more like $400 for top shelf stuff. So naturally on SR people will try to get $400/oz. <br /><br />Even if the prices are a bit more expensive, I MUCH rather deal with cryptography and infosec than young people on the street that have mouths (and use them).

				Its a little nicer than driving downtown, chilling outside a ghetto rave club, and risking being stabbed for an hour to get your fix, which may be cut with something else anyway. You sit on your ass, pay a little less than average (MDMA here is a STEAL!), and get it delivered. I love the future.

				Speaking as a vendor... it is way more work than you can imagine until you have tried it. It&#039;s like running any business with the added stress of it being illegal. And at any given moment, I have a huge amount of money tied up in escrow as well. I&#039;ve probably sunk $30,000 into SR since I started. <br /><br />I&#039;m not complaining. The escrow system keeps everyone safe, as does the anonymity of the whole SR set up. But I am not making any kind of a killing as a vendor. This is not easy money--it&#039;s work.

And as far as the prices go on here, it all depends on where you live and what drugs are readily available, for me the heroin and coke really aren&#039;t worth it on here cuz i can score in ten minutes and pay a helluva lot cheaper prices than are on here, but for mdma, weed, xanax, and a few other things, I can turn around and make a nice profit reselling it &quot;ON THE STREETS&quot; as you put it. some of us have spent YEARS in state prison and have learned a thing or two along the way, at least for me i try to keep my freedom now and i do everything i can to not lose it again, and this service offers alot of protection that you don&#039;t get &quot;ON THE STREETS&quot; with your buddies turned snitch because cops scare them with a few months in jail, and undercovers and anyway you get the point. So yes, like you said in your post, I think you are missing the whole point.

				Right? Some shit is way expensive. Like ecstasy pills and LSD. the MDMA is OKAY in price. Some people have some decent shit. but there are certain things you just need to buy local for and relay on pillreports or something.<br /><br />Hell, I&#039;d get a 10-pack of ex for $70 to $100 but on SR it can be double that. And local LSD, when it&#039;s around, is usually $5 to $10 a hit. usually in the lower ranges. Luckily it&#039;s around and I have stocked the fuck up :)<br />

				There are very few products (esp when considering bulk) that are overpriced on here. Finding an experienced seller/shipper with countless good reviews is so much better than the inconsistency of certain street drugs these days.

				I&#039;ve been here a year and i can say that when i first came on here the prices for the item i wanted most were about 50% more than street prices locally, however, because of the huge demand more and more vendors have come in and because of the added choice and competition it has not only driven prices down but shipping and customer service are also much higher because instead of 2-3vendors there are 10-15 regular ones and they know they have to provide a good product in a reasonable amount of time or we can go somewhere else, now prices for my weapon of choice are about 25% lower than street prices and i know which vendors are picky about products and which aren&#039;t. So the key to getting SR prices lower and quality higher and getting vendors that don&#039;t just mark shit &quot;in transit&quot; without sending it and you wait forever is getting more vendors competing against one another.&nbsp; Thats the trend I have noticed regarding prices here all it takes is one kick ass vendor to undercut the others and the prices with come crashing down.

				For me SR&#039;s prices are worth it because of the quality product that you can get. The road is the only place you have reviews on different sellers and their products, and one of the few places where people know what they&#039;re talking about (I have never met anyone IRL who even knew what 2C-B is).<br /><br />If you shop around you can almost always find what you&#039;re looking for at not much more than street prices (at least where I&#039;m Located). For me, the only things which I can get cheaper IRL are weed and cocaine. I get good weed around 4€ a gram and coke at 50€ a gram. MDMA for me is around 50€ a gram as well, which is more expensive than on the road.<br /><br />All in all, I love the road, and I&#039;m willing to pay that bit extra for the services it provides. Plus I have no idea where I would buy such a variety of products reliably IRL.<br />- JH<br />

				tbh I think the prices are ok. <br /><br />Even if it *is* a bit more expensive, that&#039;s the price you pay for convenience and a wider choice. <br /><br />Sitting on my arse while being able to peruse all the wares on offer, is far more appealing than feverishly ringing Dave, a mate of Dave, then a mate of Dave&#039;s mate, etc on a Friday night. <br /><br />And as I&#039;m getting older, I really can&#039;t be bothered mixing with the chav shitmunchers and all their &quot;innit bruv&quot; cobblers.

				As a vendor who has been here off and on for a year and a half, I actually think prices have gone DOWN a bit.<br /><br />I think that the reason for the increased price is due to the increased security. You are not talking to street thugs here, you are talking to and about intelligent people who usually work their assess off for a living. <br />As a vendor I know that I jack my prices up a bit here (about $5 an item), but that is because of the exchange rates. Once the BTC settles in to a more common currency, you will see prices drop.<br /><br />I will say that I think my prices are over all fair thought, I try to keep them average to prices you can get elsewhere. If it is an RC, i try to keep it AROUND clearnet pricing. Albeit a bit higher price for the goods. If its something that can be procured through clearnet or even over the counter, i try to keep my prices as equal to street prices as possible.<br /><br /><br />I do like that you can find many unique things ehre. I also like the ease of use of the site. Compared to other places, I prefer here.<br />I think the closing of the armory made me want to stay here and is why I came back to active again...<br /><br />Remember though, you are not meeting anyone in person, and you are getting items to your door. IMHO that is worth the extra cost... Even if its sometimes quadruple the price I could buy it for, Escrow is my main reason to buy here over elsewhere. It&#039;s worth my money not to have to waste my time.

				In my opinion the prices here depend from substance to substance, for me i can get weed as low as 3€ a gram coke for 45€&nbsp; a gram and hash for 3/4€ a gram all this if I buy in bulk, i may start selling if these prices don&#039;t change, but in my opinion I don&#039;t mind paying an extra when you don&#039;t have to have the trouble calling some guy waiting for tons of time and when the quality can be shitty or the weight can be lower than expected, i also like the fact that you don&#039;t meet this person to person it&#039;s all anonymous and safe, you get all your info on the substance and what does it do to you, the quality, the weight, the way it was packed on the forums and reviews, with that in mind i don&#039;t mind paying some extra for substances that are very hard to get like pure lsd pure dmt etc, i&#039;ve never been happier i feel like a kid in a sweet shop.<br /><br />Also i think the prices will just adjust since more people like me see a shot on making big bucks so they will starting selling with lower prices, like for example Carlos Lopez was a new seller that i only found on the 7&#039;th page of cannabis and now he&#039;s jumping ranks like a madmen he found a shot he saw the prices were lower and now he&#039;s making big bucks, it&#039;s all a matter of time now imho.

				I think the prices are OK for the quality you can get.&nbsp; <br />Then again, I live in the Midwest US, so most of the things on here I&#039;m interested in, I simply CANNOT get without traveling to the source myself.<br />So far the prices have been right in line with street prices, some a little more, some a little less.&nbsp; The trusted vendors with 100% seem to understand the balance between competitive pricing and still making a good profit.&nbsp; Most of the expensive listing you see are most likely going to be from people who don&#039;t have the reputation or supply necessary to allow them to price competitively.&nbsp; <br />All of this; combined with the convenience of having everything you want shipped to you without the need for some shady back-alley deal where you have no real idea where you&#039;re getting, is well worth a little premium for me.

				Supply and demand will always dictate the pricing of any market over time.&nbsp; If the vendors set prices too high relative to to actual demand, the price will fall or more vendors will come to market to make those margins thus driving the pricing back to equilibrium.&nbsp; If prices are too low relative to supply, demand will outstrip supply and prices will correspondingly rise as vendors move to keep product available to those willing to pay at the margin.&nbsp; Now your local market,being a different market than the SR market, gives rise to the opportunity for arbitrage.&nbsp;

				If you can call up a mate and get cheaper prices, by far do not let anyone else here stop you.<br /><br />But the way I see it is that what SR offers is well worth the extra you might pay if any at all.<br /><br />I know where I live, using SR is well worth it, no Face2Face, the Escrow system, the Feedback methods.<br /><br />Using the forums in itself is priceless, being able to compare and buy what you want without any hassle or problems most of the time.<br /><br />That is very worth the extra you might end up paying.

				I haven&#039;t found things to be that expensive. I&#039;m in a busy UK area well known for cheap drugs, and the prices on here seem fine. So far I&#039;ve only ordered ketamine (and I was lucky enough to get a sample gram of some lovely weed for an absolute steal, about a quarter of street prices), and it is virtually the same price on here by weight, but the stuff on here is uncut crystal delivered to your door and the street stuff is cut powder (probably cut in half at least). Honestly I think most stuff works out cheaper here when you take quality/purity into account. I seen a study that claimed that most of the street coke here averages about 5% coke, and it is usually about £30-40 a gram, granted coke on here is generally a multiple of that in price, but if the coke here is truly as advertised, which I believe it is, then that still works out cheaper for the actual amount of cocaine you are getting when you buy. I&#039;m not even interested in coke though, too expensive for my tastes (although maybe I would change my opinion if I tried some of the SR stuff instead of the shite that passes for coke here)<br /><br />The other things I have looked at which I would buy are mdma/pills, speed, mcat, methoxetamine (which I can&#039;t even get IRL any more, cut or uncut) and all of these so far look pretty much the same price as street. The pills that sell on here for about £6-7 sell for £10 on the street (the really good pills), the speed on the street here is usually pretty poor, the mcat has been cut to fuck and costs about £20/g and it&#039;s cheaper than that here and probably cut way less.<br /><br />Hash and skunk seem a fair bit pricier on here than street, but that doesn&#039;t bother me cos I rarely smoke weed anyway. But even with that I suspect the hash here still works out better value for money than the soap bar that floats around the streets. Not sure about the green, we seem to get pretty good green here.<br /><br />Overall, not only do I love the service... I have no complaints about prices, and it&#039;s not like I live somewhere where drugs are rare and expensive.

				I came around after the 420 sale last year. Since then the prices are all about the same. Most of the prices are tied to a dollar amount. Legit LSD was about $10 for a 100 ug hit. MDMA presses pills were between $10-$20 depending on dosage. RCs were dirt cheap.&nbsp; GHB/GBL has gotten a little more scarce. And weed is all over the place depending on quality. Those are the only drugs I can really speak for.

				I find weed to be extremely fair priced. I don&#039;t dabble in anything else so I wouldnt know the prices of anything else.

				Yep, it is expensive here for the quality products, except the Mary Jane seems some what reasonable, quality perscription drugs should be only a few bucks a piece in any market in my opinion...&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh well, I guess it&#039;s a supply and demand thing.

				I personally find cannabis over priced for UK domestic buyers, prescription meds mostly benzos to be reasonably priced and psychedelics are quite highly priced but there is no other way of getting DMT or lucy round here so the road is my only option!

Plus it&#039;s quite fun to do and feel proud when you get some nice crystals that you pulled out of a plant all by yourself using science&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />It really is *very* easy. I advise checking out (clearweb) www.dmt-nexus.me and looking at the STB (straight to base) teks in the wiki. It can seem complicated at first, but it&#039;s really not. I&#039;d even be happy to tell you in simple instructions how I do it and where to buy all the shit you need, it&#039;s all legal and not expensive (it&#039;s really only 3 things. Mimosa Hositilis root bark, caustic soda and a solvent). PM me if you want :)<br /><br />You&#039;re right about acid though, I&#039;ve only ever bought acid here (Scotland) once in my life and it was expensive and not very good. may not even have been acid, who knows.

				I guess it depends on what are you looking for and your location. I´ve ordered (and received) ecstasy pills and 25i at a very good price. Weed is quite expensive but many strains are AAAA+, that kind of weed is hard to find in my country so I´m going to order some nugs. In the other hand, I find cocaine to be extremely expensive since I live in SA.

				All my favourite drugs are cheaper on the road than in the UK, so I can&#039;t say I&#039;m one to complain!&nbsp; ;D

				It&#039;s not that much more from what I gather and the convenience and increased certainty of what you&#039;re getting is absolutely worth it to me.

				I&#039;ve been reading these forums a lot over the past few weeks, and there seems to be complete and utter discontent for the wave of new UK cannabis vendors. People not receiving their orders, coupled with poor communication, with those vendors names and reputations being slashed and torn beyond repair. Scary times for new vendors starting out. Get it right or GTFO seems to be the message permeating from the threads.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m a new UK vendor. I have everything I need to start up trading, just waiting to harvest my latest crop (I only activated my account this early because of the price of BTC, I figured they&#039;d peaked, and they had!:) ).&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering why the hell these new vendors haven&#039;&#039;t planned their new business properly? Are they teenagers trying to make some money and falling down on the professionalism? Is it complete lack of business sense? Are they just here to scam people?&nbsp; Do they not have any idea of the OPPORTUNITY they have before them thanks to BTC and DPR &amp; the SR team? These questions are all valid, but also completely unanswerable in an anonymous market place. <br /><br />I&#039;ve spent the last 2-3 months researching, familiarising, researching, reading, researching, asking questions, researching. You get the message. I&#039;ve been working hard to build a supply chain of everything I need to stealthily deliver your product, on time, within 24-48 hours of you clicking &#039;add to cart&#039;. I literally have enough in stealthy P&amp;P for the first 200 orders. I didn&#039;t want to leave anything to chance.<br /><br />I won&#039;t be able to supply one gram of product for at least another 6-8 weeks. But rather than sit there twiddling my thumbs, I&#039;m getting out there (on here), trying to show all my prospective customers that I am here for good! I&#039;ve been growing for a number of years now and have always had a fantastic response from my customers. And they keep coming back, time and time again. Why? I&#039;m a friendly guy. I turn up when I say I&#039;m going to turn up. I bring exactly the amount they ordered. I even carry around a little bit of change in case they don&#039;t have the correct money. The way I see it, I&#039;m a businessman, not a dealer. I produce a product off my own back, using my own skills. I market it, I run my own quality control, I price it, I bag it, I deliver it. It&#039;s not that hard to do... if you&#039;re professional.<br /><br />The way I see it, BTC&#039;s and SR have created a hole in space time. It feels like we&#039;re in the Wild West, a new frontier. I have a product that I produced with my own hands using my own skills, and you want some. No Government regulation, no red tape, no tax, and using BTC&#039;s and Tor, it&#039;s pretty much anonymous. New vendors should be appreciative of the opportunity before them, as I do. <br /><br />I believe the key to a successful vendor account on SR is professionalism. Fail to be professional, and you will fail as a vendor.<br /><br />CKUK<br /><br />Please check out my Vendor page and become a fan - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6d2a775602<br /><br />

				Ok I see, cheers. Personally I think it&#039;s less risky selling on here than in the real world. It&#039;s definitely the future. I rarely buy drugs off the street now, due to the mediocre quality of pills and cocaine in my area.

				I&#039;ll be honest and say I have very little real world experience with buying pills and cocaine. That&#039;s not to say I don&#039;t have any experience with pills and coke, but time and experience has taught me they&#039;re not really my drugs of choice. I&#039;d much rather smoke a doob :)<br /><br />However, if I was in the market for those types of products I would definitely use SR. And never FE!!!!<br /><br />CKUK

				I used to smoke alot of weed from my teens up until my mid 20&#039;s. Used to really enjoy it, but then it started to give me very bad anxiety. I can&#039;t smoke it anymore, just a couple of tokes and I can&#039;t speak to anybody. It makes me very paranoid and I overthink everything. Its a shame reall because I used to enjoy it, not sure what happened. I know a lot of people in a similar situation. I used to be a grower myself for a while, it&#039;s very rewarding nurturing a crop. Yeah FE always!

				Perhaps the pills and the coke had something to do with your anxiety levels ;) Nah, I get what you&#039;re saying. I&#039;ve found in my experience the mind does need to clear, dreams need to be dreamt. You can&#039;t go to bed high every night and smoke all day. That&#039;s when I start having anxiety. But smoking every so often does the mind good IMO. Cannabis and humans have been enjoying a symbiotic evolution for thousands of years. Hopefully, many more thousand to come!<br /><br />CKUK

				Yeah pills and cocaine can definitely cause anxiety, I used to take a hell of alot of ecstasy when i was younger and this was probably a factor with my anxiety. Cannabis should definitely be legalised, its ridiculous that alcohol, one of the most powerful and destructive drugs known to man is legal and socially acceptable. I find it strange that people who are anti drugs think that drinking alcohol is acceptable, but smoking cannabis and taking mdma isnt when in fact both of these drugs are far less damaging. I&#039;m sure alot of people have seen professor David Nutts dangerous drug list (http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/nov/02/david-nutt-dangerous-drug-list) and yet the government just ignore this advice. I think cannabis should definitely be lower down, unfortunately the media tend to exaggerate and demonise it. The annual deaths from alcohol and tobacco especially are incredible yet they are still legal. Crazy. Rant over.

Passion is they key to becoming a successful vendor! It can&#039;t be just about the money. You&#039;ve got to LOVE what you do, then the money is just a bi-product of that love. I&#039;m not ready to announce anything about my future prices, but we&#039;ve put together a rip-roaring deal to our first 10 customers. I&#039;ll be sure to announce it on my own thread plenty of time before we open. I just need to get to 50 posts and am not sitting there spamming. Ok, I do every now and then, but I prefer to gain them organically, much like my crops :)<br /><br />Thanks for you kind comments, I aim to please!<br /><br />CKUK

				Good to hear your are taking it seriously and doing your homework. If you do grow well your products will speak for themselves and you should be able to sell it cheaper than the competition by cutting out the middle man. Only a few years ago an oz of the best was around £120, now it is probably double that, and some sellers on SR are charging even more. Obviously you have SR fee and to cash out bitcoins, but if i was a growing I think I would charge 160-200 an oz, it would make the competition think, and cost to produce should be around £20 an oz(?) once your growing business is&nbsp; established, so everyone is a winner.&nbsp; I would guess the reason this has not been done is that those who grow and are able to sell for reasonable prices have no problem getting rid of it face to face! <br /><br />I would like to hear a little bit about your growing methods&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Growing and selling is risky&nbsp; :-\ im sure you are aware, but selling on SR is probably, safer for you.<br /><br />Good luck!

				You&#039;d be surprised how much it costs to produce an oz of quality weed to a high standard. Electricity costs alone can be astronomical by average household standards. Couple that with inflation over the last few years and the cost to produce sky rockets, and so must the consumer price. Having said that, I do think some of the weed I&#039;ve seen on the road is very expensive indeed. I&#039;ve done my calculations and KNOW I can beat 90% of the prices I see out there, and still maintain a worth while margin. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be starting a thread soon. I&#039;d be more than happy to answer questions about my growing methods, and maybe even help out any aspiring growers out there. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been growing and selling for years. I&#039;m very aware of the risks involved. However, as long as the variables have been considered, calculated, and planned for, the risk can be minimised :)<br /><br />CKUK

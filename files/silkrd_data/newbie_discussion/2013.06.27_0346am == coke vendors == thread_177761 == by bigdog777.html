				Interesting, I thought kingofthetrill had legit shit from what has been said. I&#039;ve only bought coke once on here so far and that was party blow from Licentia. Wasn&#039;t the best (60% coke) but he was completely upfront so I wasn&#039;t let down. Even then it was still pretty fucking good though, better than any coke you can buy on the streets (and his price for half a gram wasn&#039;t bad). I really want to try Studio54&#039;s pure disco shit but I&#039;m waiting for payday to come around for that.<br />There&#039;s a thread around this forum somewhere that has the purity tests of a lot of well known coke vendors on here.

				yeah bungees was tested anonimously at 87% out of highest 89%.&nbsp; I don&#039;t trust the agreement tests...I know that vendors have great blow, what they send to someone that they know is testing and posting result and what they send&nbsp; to others can be way different, so I only trust the tested without an agreement(anonymous) tested shit....the pure disco shit was an agreement, but others have given his shit good ratings also so I&#039;m gonna try it.

				Oh yeah bungees, his name totally slipped my mind. I haven&#039;t been able to check out his vendor page yet but I&#039;ve seen the reviews. That makes a lot of sense not to trust agreement tests. I actually haven&#039;t heard much about it and how it&#039;s done exactly so it&#039;s good to know that now. The coke I&#039;ve done in real life was pure pure shit. I never bought it because my friends boyfriend was in the business (cartel or somethin&#039;) so he always had a bit on him that we could sample all we want. It made me feel so euphoric and good it was crazy. I haven&#039;t been able to get my hands on some pure coke like that since so now I&#039;m just on the look out for the one vendor haha.

				I live in middle united states so the good shit around here has been cut minimum 2 times, so the best of the best maybe 60% pure.&nbsp; until the road that&#039;s what my choice was....now that I&#039;ve had and am on right now bungees shit....I know what 90% plus clean ass coke is.....I do about 25% less per dose and it last twice as long and is so euphoric.&nbsp; &nbsp;I dont even mind paying over 2 times what I pay locally too because it is soooo worth it. if you have the BTC I would tell everyone they need to at the very least try it....<br /><br />peace

				Been waiting nearly 2 weeks for PablosPuro order to get to me. Very poor communication. Four emails went unanswered and then he asks ME a question! I answer it and still no idea where the order is. Yes, people are complaining about his deliveries. I waited...and waited. Now will likely have to cancel order and hope that he gets his act together for a possible larger order. I&#039;ll be following the comments on this vendor with keen interest. Glad I did not FE.

				i just split a gram of sukeys ultra clean high quality coke with 3 guys... I&#039;m not saying it was bad at all and i&#039;m not knocking on sukey, but i feel like it wasn&#039;t 83 plus percent . We started off with .05 lines and ended with about .08 lines. anybody else recently try his ultra clean high quality stuff? I think it was good( 7/10) but not worrth $185

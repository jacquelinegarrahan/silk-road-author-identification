				Hey guys - new scam out... don&#039;t trust him until the support declares it trustworthy (which i don&#039;t think) - have send message to vendorsupport.<br />Edit: It&#039;s scam. SR don&#039;t send out messages like this. Be aware!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From: Lynde<br /><br />Silk Road News<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Lynde. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Silk Road.<br />Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.<br />I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR &amp; GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with DPR&#039;s forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138016.0 Or message him here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/b1e30b5819 Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200&#039;000 per month or $2&#039;400&#039;000 annually Shares will be priced at $500 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc (see below) at Mt. Gox&#039;s weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your SR account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it.<br />Payment address - 1E7MvdRjSvCCPNPhNwAqKVsYSwFj2Bpp9x<br /><br />If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.<br />Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging SR Financial here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/733d1d49e8 with your Transaction ID, User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.<br /><br />Example Subject - SR Investments<br />277349296<br />Lynde - 4 x 0.1 - ฿17.64<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck<br />Lynde SR Staff</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

It would also go against the idea of freedom that Silk Road represents if user accounts were being banned. Everybody is responsible for their own actions, and whilst I feel terribly sorry for the people that are getting scammed by these messages it is up to each individual to check things out before putting their money into them, just as they would do with real-world transactions or investments.<br /><br />+1 for bringing it to the attention of others though!<br /><br />Libertas

				Ah okay, i understand.&nbsp; Thats okay in my eyes cause everybody has the chance to use forums or other sources to see if the user is trustworthy who send out messages like this. Hopefully this guys didn&#039;t get money through the scam.<br /><br />Thanks for karma :) Other question.. (a little bit offtopic) - Is there any chance to get the right to post in the other forums under 50 posts or had i spam up to 50 for these? I&#039;m a Vendor, for now round about 2 month and the &quot;50-posts-thing&quot; keeps me away from the forums, but this seems to be a very nice place to discuss. If there is no way, i will see how i get push up my posts :D<br /><br />best regards<br />germanHQpharm

Many people use the &#039;spam to 50&#039; threads to do so, and whilst we do not necessarily condone that it is generally tolerated as long as the users don&#039;t spam in threads where actual discussion is taking place.<br /><br />Best of luck with it! :)<br /><br />Libertas

I get what you&#039;re saying about having paid to become a vendor (which is a refundable bond, so they do get it back if they meet the conditions of the bond), but it just wouldn&#039;t be fair. That is how two-tier societies develop, from something as small as being able to pay for something and receiving extra privileges, and that&#039;s not something we want to encourage in the Silk Road forum community.<br /><br />Just in case anybody&#039;s wondering, the 50 post rule was brought in to protect the main forums from the mass-spam that you sometimes might see in the Newbie forum. We delete that as soon as we see it but if we did not keep it confined to one place it would get out of hand and make discussion on all of the forums impossible.<br /><br />Libertas

				Oh fine -.-<br />Have checked the BTC address from scam today - they got only 1 btc...<br /><br />All Newb&#039;s be aware of scams like ths, they come very often since the big scam from the guys who get about 850 BTC<br /><br />This was before ... but semms that they have got nothing:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From: Vote 420<br /><br />Happy 4/20!<br /><br />Today got off to a rough start, but now it&#039;s your chance to help make things a little smoother from now on. There have been several new ideas in the forums, and we are now looking at starting to implement some of them.<br /><br />The biggest request we get is for a new rating system. There have been discussions in the forum about what would be best, but we really want the vendors to help make the decision. You are the ones who live by the rating system, and we want to work with you to bring everyone a better experience at SR. If you would like us to focus on the ratings system, please vote by sending BTC to:<br /><br />1RATEaFf2kYmLgEMH5164EsUiz8kWrGDR<br />Vendors who send at least 0.5 BTC will be among the first eligible to use the new ratings system.<br /><br />If you have not noticed, the speed at which we are able to respond to support tickets has been rather slow lately. SR has been growing, while the staff has remained limited. We would like to implement a program where vendors can help resolve support tickets. The safest way would to be to have the tickets first go through the main staff. Depending on the severity, they will either keep it to be resolved by staff, or send it to the vendors. At any time a vendor could check the list of unresolved tickets and give support. Some tickets will require the consensus of other vendors, or a staff member to keep things safe. Tickets go to the first responder, and will be worth $10 in waived fees. If you like this idea, please send BTC to:<br /><br />1ADMiNcSUZ5bCMsA3LaDQgfyk1z65ugQe9<br />Vendors who send at least 2.5 BTC can begin in May, two months before everyone else.<br /><br />We have tried everything to make the site faster for everyone. Our most recent improvements have helped, but heavy traffic still bogs down the Tor network. We have been experimenting with adding Tor relays at various strategic locations. This seems to work, but we really need to add more to make a difference. The relays only run inside the Tor network, and never exit. Adding more relays would help the entire TOR network, and keep SR available in times of high traffic. If you like to see us add more relays, please vote by sending BTC to:<br /><br />1RELAYeP5R89C4ouunjyJdqfMeQx2XZdB<br />Vendors who send more than 5 BTC will get a private relay that always maintains the the fastest connection speed with SR. It can be easily added to your Tor configuration, and you may share it with anyone you wish.<br /><br />One of the biggest things we have been working on is a full-fledged app for SR. Our vendor app has finally moved from the alpha stage into the beta stage. It still basic, but it does everything you can do on SR, and offers additional functionality. It opens up as a simple calculator, and only opens when you enter 42271 + 37814. Once open you can specify a password, which will be used for encryption. Messages and listings can be stored and edited offline. You can generate multiple BTC wallets that can be used to keep track of different listings, and you can keep the private keys offline, so your money is always safe. You can also create custom listing templates, use a new scheduling feature, and more. We have created an API for all SR functions, and are working on maximizing the potential of our app. If you like to support the API, and the development of the vendor app, please send BTC to:<br /><br />1SRapiKveLoV13oxda9g5BhBcYGFwv4EC<br />Vendors who send at least 10 BTC will get the full API documentation, and source code for our cross-platform app. Working binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac are included in the build directory, however compiling from source is very simple with the documentation. Since the item is still in beta, there will be several updates. You will always get the latest updates and new features. Any item listed using the vendor app while it is still in beta will have ALL FEES WAIVED! As beta testers, you would be helping us work out any minor bugs before we fully release it, so we want to make it worth your while.<br /><br />SR is really becoming a great place. It&#039;s because of your hard work that SR has been able to grow the way it has. If you have any new ideas, please don&#039;t hesitate to put them forward. We appreciate everything you do for the community here, and want to help keep everything alive and well.<br /><br />We look forward to more great things.<br />Thank you all</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

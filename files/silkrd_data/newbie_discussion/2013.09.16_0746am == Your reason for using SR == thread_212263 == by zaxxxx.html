				Well this has probably been done to death, but its worth a post or 3 :)<br /><br />For me local supplies of weed have either dried up or the dealers are so paranoid despite me giving them 1000s over the years through a 3rd party (who ive fallen out with) they wont deal with me directly.<br /><br />The straw that broke the camels back was a friend getting me some &quot;weed&quot; that was ground leaf and shit.<br /><br />So here I am in the SR candy store with more varieties of cannabis to choose from than I ever knew existed.<br /><br />Been smoking 20 years and the products listed make me feel like a inexperienced newb lol

				Hey, I gotta say i&#039;m a noob too. don&#039;t worry @ one time or another we all are, or were. I just became a vendor and yes you are right about the choices. From a vendor standpoint you are way safer here than most of all the other marketplaces combined.

				My reason?<br /><br />First, I was simply tired of dealing with dealers. Meth dealers in particular can be a crazy bunch if they use the product themselves...and...we&#039;ll EVERY meth dealer I&#039;ve met in person only sells it to fund their own habit. Some of the craziest fuckers I&#039;ve ever met. Shady as hell too. I usually had about 50/50 chance of getting ripped off with one.<br /><br />Second, the selection on SR is amazing!!!! So many things to choose from. For instance, I would never find ketamine on the streets...plenty of vendors selling it on SR, though. I&#039;m probably gonna try it here soon.

				drinkNlove is absolutely right about some meth dealers being insane.<br /><br />I use this place for the convenience, the safety, the peer-reviewed quality, the rare drugs, and sometimes the good prices.<br />I started with the pure xanax powder that was/is a killer deal. Most things are expensive but quality, but some things are priced better than street prices AND they are better quality. :)<br /><br />It is kinda fun too, but most dangerous things are.<br />I also like that it is nerdy.

				I occasionally smoke weed, but the dial-a-bag stuff that goes round our town is absolutely awful.<br /><br />Unless you know a personal grower who will sell you some decent, well-cured bud at 20-25£ for a proper (3.5g) 8th, you have to rely on these shady asian or black gangs who will deliver you a &#039;20 bag&#039;, to your door, by car.<br /><br />You usually only get 2g&#039;s or this strange hard small nugget bud that doesn&#039;t smell quite right, tastes rather acrid and gives a kind of chemical high. The jury&#039;s out on what they actually do to it and our govenrment doesn&#039;t have any harm reduction strategy so you can&#039;t get it tested but I&#039;ve heard that it could be anything from not flushing the nutes in the final two weeks of grow, to something called Brix+ that supposedly speeds up the curing process or even worse, shit bud sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids.<br /><br />Needless to say, I can buy an 8th of decent quality hash for about £30 off the Road and as I don&#039;t smoke much, this lasts me over a month.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made purchases for other things such as MDMA and pills for friends and they&#039;ve always commented on the quality of the product compared to street drugs.

				My main reason is the quality of Coke &amp; MD around here is dire at best. Before the MD dried up altogether 1g was like £40 and you&#039;d get like .8 and it wasn&#039;t anything special. And the coke which is 3g for £100 or £40/g has more cuts then coke in my opinion.<br /><br />Atleast with SR, you know what you&#039;re getting (Most of the time) I have bought MD and ended up with methylone but the vendor(s) have always provided a refund upon showing them the test.

				I&#039;m quite only using weed and hash, sometimes harder drugs but not often.<br />In my city it&#039;s really annoying to find hash or weed, weed is like very good but quite always 15euro for 1 g ... so expansive ... and hash is never top quality, often bad commercial hash and price varies between 6 and 12 for 1 g of hash ...<br />The most annoying thing is when you find a good deal, you are sure that will not last a long time ..., one day you have 10 numbers to call when you need to smoke and the other day you have only 2-3 numbers still selling hash/weed but you don&#039;t know if they will answer...<br />I was really tired of running after assholes who have no fucking clue of what punctuality is.<br />Thoses assholes absolutly don&#039;t care you are customer, you are nothing but money coming to them, they bullshit you on the time you should met, they bullshit you on the quality/price they are offering you ... that really tired me ...<br />So we decided with a friend to grow some weed but we still live at our mom&#039;s house, so we tried to grow guerrilla style ^^ in the nature and it worked one year but we got caught the second year .... so here I am, buying my products to trusted sellers not scamming me and bullshiting me all the time, resending me the 0.4g missing if it was missing.<br />Thoses street dealers just don&#039;t know shit about real business.<br />Silkroad is what I call a real business.<br />If I pay for something I know what quality and what quantity I will have, and this feels like liberty and real business my friends : )

				found out about SR about a year ago but have never really used it until recently. cannabis in my area is very easy to come by, but the other drugs only come through once in a blue moon and the quality/supply is always a guess. SR has shown me that you are able to see what you get, know whats in your drugs, and read reviews and learn more about other drugs. so far i really enjoy the community and how helpful they have been in answering questions. i hope SR continues to thrive as IMO this is the safest way to get your drugs.

				I&#039;m here mostly for things that my regular supplier doesn&#039;t sell, mostly stuff that&#039;s interested me but I&#039;ve never tried (such as methamphetamine, mephedrone and NBOMes) and also coke, which I like occasionally but have to deal with very untrustworthy characters to obtain IRL. That supplier has also had some legal troubles recently so I&#039;m also looking at more common psychedelics and hashish, although the prices for the latter seem much higher on SR than I&#039;m accustomed to. The nerdiness is indeed another factor, as is the feeling of being involved in a truly revolutionary project.

				I orig. started being a user after understanding how weak our (usa) postal system is-it&#039;s a 24/7 365 system of overworked, underpaid (salaries imo don&#039;t make a direct connection between security/lack of/attentiveness having a system full of workers whom are focused with their petite lives, internal politics, worries is that much more likely to overlook, not ask questions or frankly GIVE A FUCK about what their(foot soldiers, paper pushers, drivers ect are essentially handling. After the above has been assessed I then took into account my rights as a citizen, the position of where I&#039;m at in life such as monitary-last thing i wana do is become broke or worse owe some strange online drug dealer (not an offensive comment I&#039;d do what I needed to do too if I was owed) OR get hooked to some wacky/super awesome/life destroying (in order):Cannabinoids&amp;Cathinones/Psycadelics:Lsd.Dmt.Dipt/Methamphetamine <br />All this was taken into account before arranging a purchase or even creating an account. I made myself well aware of the demon that could be awaiting me if (and I did) tried harder drugs that local access was unknown. Your will power is as strong as your morals. <br />I used sr at first because I felt no paranoia, being inside a residence waiting for what others don&#039;t know/care/want to know about (others being family friends, postal employes, LE) until the severity of charges started to out way my luxority of hand delivered adventures,stories,trips,memories<br />The last memory I want is that my body was raped and then killed in prison for whatever reason related to a sr arrest. That&#039;s just not wise<br />Let&#039;s not forget as nifty as sr is the inherent dangers that tend to follow modern drug laws are still present<br />No matter what, there is NO success story to drug dealing, everyone will get caught at some point if they do not die or quit first.<br />Sr has brought me like stated adventures that would never of been had<br />Knowledge and lessons that wouldn&#039;t of been learned when it did<br />(negative with silver outlining) would I of ever tried meth yet alone use it for many months without silkroad?<br />Most likely no, but then again if the curiosity was there when it was, it would of been there later on in life. Did I value what was learned by crystal? Of course, I was unaware of how able-physically and mentally I am.<br />Big key point was learning time doesn&#039;t exist in a sense, in the sense it does, the measurements are equal regardless of the situation. I found how much likeability posses. Ect.<br />Would I of ever experienced more exotic chemicals such as for me the life changing trip with Dipt? In the current illegality of drugs (although dipt tech. isn&#039;t illegal in usa possibly analog act) rare tryptamines can only find so many people by word of mouth and hand to hand exchanges. I fully believe I&#039;ll never come across that chemical again dipt-sound oh my sound I could only expand in another post on what knowledge came to me by using dipt. One specifically was how I (at the time I didn&#039;t) value my senses, also that senses are necessary to life equally, senses is a state of mind when my brain is told to, I can do whatever I want, numerous ways. Simple as not liking certain foods has dissipated. A sign of maturing? Possible, an insight of how senses exist as much as time does, has been life changing. For those not following/non crazies, all insecurities, fears, limits are all within put on ourselves and do erase when we understand and choose to do so.&nbsp; With learning no bounds came physical strength gains, a desire to excellence with health. Really if I had thought about my initial use of sr i&#039;d have a full diary noting chemical use- trip report&amp;after thoughts. This though would only make my experiences real, as written down proof, everything in my head as far as you should be concerned, isn&#039;t real.<br /><br />TL;DR: I use(d) SR with the intentions of expanding my experiences, some better than others but all equally important. Sr shouldn&#039;t be taken lightly as we (buyers sellers users abusers) are at risk to some capacity. Sr has helped me learn that saying yes to myself is selfish, not how real life works, and can bring unintended consequences. Would call my experiments coming to and end by choice might I add. The drugs consumed via Sr has brought me insight that I enjoy living hear on our temporary planet. Any known damage to by body has not been taken lightly, currently have ear damage which didn&#039;t exist before Dipt (although dipt was one of the few not from Sr am making Sr and online grey/black markets synonymous, without directly blaming a chemical itself (it didn&#039;t damage me I damaged myself by taking it led me to appreciate all there is to be learned discovered gained and lastly LOST. Because just like the drugs we obtain, our now is only now and can&#039;t be expected to be there in the future.<br />I would and do not promote Sr to anyone although it can be accessed by anyone, only some who would not of already been exposed to the chemical library should enter at their own risk. As helpful as substances have been to me the opposite should be prepared for and assumed to be. If an individual isn&#039;t ready to lawyer up, jail it up and die to expand their consciousness and on the opposite end *responsibly*give-share and expand others, then they(potential Sr user) are not ready to be exposed.<br /><br />This is a sober persons thoughts<br />If the above post can be seen as damage done by substances I only petty you<br />

Hir TL;DR at the end is easier to read, especially if one takes, &quot;am making Sr and online grey/black markets synonymous,&quot; into account. In short, I think, it&#039;s that black markets and illegal drug use have both positive and negative aspects so weigh up the potential personal costs and benefits before getting involved with them. Some of it seems slightly extreme to me (is that oxymoronic?) but the post strikes me as being a valuable subjective reflection.

				I just moved to a painfully small, very heavily policed town. Lost all my connections when I moved, and even before moving I could really only get coke, crack and the occasional opiate or other assorted substance. Honestly I&#039;m still working up the nerve to use SR for the first time. Trying to learn everything I can here in this forum before I pull the trigger, that way I know more about what I&#039;m doing and can be safest.

				i started using SR for reliability. im sick of dealers falling through, giving BS excuses, selling shit product while talking it up. its just too much hassle to deal with the street jokers, when you can have w/e you want, whenever you want, at whatever price is competitive. i dont mind paying a premium price for a premium product WITH premium service, im all for that as a matter of fact, and you honestly just cant get that reliably from the street.

				I use a lot of different drugs. Acid happens to be my favorite, but is almost impossible to find on the street without getting some chemical other than LSD. So I come here to get my LSD. I&#039;m so glad this place exists.

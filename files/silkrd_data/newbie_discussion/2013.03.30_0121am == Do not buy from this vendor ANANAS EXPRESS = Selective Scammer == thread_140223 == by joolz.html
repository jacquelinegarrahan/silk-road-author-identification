				If you haven&#039;t finalized, I am sure you can show SR staff at the resolution center him trying to extort you to FE in order to send. If the money is on escrow Im sure youll get it back.

				Scammers should just sit down and eat a large bowl of shit. It&#039;s pure insanity to soil a system this beautiful with that kind of garbage. I just don&#039;t understand. Whenever humanity discovers something great, the shit eaters always manage to infect it. <br />Can&#039;t we all just get along? lol...

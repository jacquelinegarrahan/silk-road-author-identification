				Search for some domestic samples and new vendors. Check out my listings, as they are tailored for a more occassional user than a reseller. With BTC at such a high value I think quite a few of my listings could be afforded with ฿1.<br /><br />If you were a small percentage short you could message me to make an exception either to let it slide, or I&#039;d just throw my trust in your hands to pay me back when you have the chance. Regular customers would definitely benefit from contacting me if they were a bit short on BTC for an order. I could always just offer less to match the value that you are offering, spot you the small extra charges, or offer you a special discounted listing if I like you and/or have had positive orders sent to you.

				I save mine for the next time. So far it has always increased in value. It helps with the transaction fees and fluctuating prices and postage that you didn&#039;t look at properly. A few times I would actually not have had enough to make my purchase if it wasn&#039;t for the BTC I had left over from my last transaction.

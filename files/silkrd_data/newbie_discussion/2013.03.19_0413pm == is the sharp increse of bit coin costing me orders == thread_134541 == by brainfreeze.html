				well yeah.<br /><br />assuming the price gradually increases, some will be better off waiting for the price to stabilise at a higher price (looking to be 56-59 now) so they can either a) save money or b) get free drugs.

				Purely from a buyers point of view, it&#039;s not making any impact on my purchasing. I made two orders today. If you are basing you prices on the € or $ currency and updating regularly in accordance with bitcoin prices then I don&#039;t think you should have an issue.

				^^Agreed.&nbsp; Base your prices on $$ and update them regularly, so it doesn&#039;t matter how much BTC I&#039;m spending as long as the BTC/$$$/dope ratio matches

				I would imagine the steep rise in price is costing you orders, it stands to reason, when the value of any currency goes up, people hold back on making purchases, especially discretionary purchases. I spent the last of my BC over the last couple of days, at the value I paid, I&#039;m sick as a dog now, I could have had an extra 10-15% &gt;:( <br />Never mind, hopefully, I&#039;ll be high soon and it won&#039;t matter :P

				back when i vended i made the mistake of placing ad based on BTC.&nbsp; &nbsp;just thought i&#039;d support the currency or some stupid shit.&nbsp; well, it was pretty stable give or take a couple bucks then.&nbsp; suddenlty i realized my orders were not coming in.&nbsp; well, a 50% rise in BTC value that day had suddenlty made my orders 50% higher.&nbsp; so a gram that was 100 USD was now 150USD.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />i think you can see the problem with this approach.

				&nbsp;:) :) :) :) :) :) thanks for the reply&#039;s people. Just cpl of things my prices change as the price of&nbsp; BTC&#039;s goes up so no need to worry on that&nbsp; :). I am worried tho that if it continues to rise that it will burst and lets put it this fuck a lot of people up who are holding coins&nbsp;

				i had this experience over at BMR with my shrooms. customer told me BTC kept resetting when he put enough in there to a new level. Apparently BMR updates BTC prices every five minutes<br /><br />but after a few tries he got the right amount. I think that might be a problem when BTC goes up or down really fast like it is right now, cause 30 seconds later it&#039;s a new price sometimes<br /><br />but my prices are pegged to the dollar so now it&#039;s under .17BTC so it&#039;s like the cheapest thing there

				To tell you the truth this raise in the BTC price made me stop ordering and keep my coins until I can purchase what I want or at least until price starts dropping .

				Deadwood - Not huge on &quot;Westerns,&quot; but this show is AMAZING!&nbsp; So happy I was talked into watching, as I am on my second viewing. With only three seasons, this one ended a season or two too soon, but so many awesome actors, great dialogue and plot lines.&nbsp; I have so many favorite characters on this show: too many to list, but Ian McShane truly steals the show.&nbsp; Truly worth a watch!&nbsp; *This TV show also has the most &quot;f-words&quot; per minute than any other show in the history of TV.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers to all you cocksuckers!&nbsp; lol!&nbsp; :)

				The Office, American Version<br /><br />Glad I finally watched the last season. Didn&#039;t realize how much I missed the characters, even without Michael Scott. Loved the special they did at the end. Never thought this comedy could bring tears to my eyes, but it did.&nbsp; lol

				I am just starting the Netflix original that I mentioned, &quot;Orange is the New Black,&quot; by Weeds creator Jenji Cohen.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize this is based on a true story, Piper Chapman&#039;s memoir of her time in women&#039;s prison.&nbsp; Might have to pick up the book someday, when I stop watching and get back to my reading.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; It is pretty good so far, IMO.

Last season ended with such a cliffhanger! I planned to wait til all episodes have aired, and then binge them but I know that&#039;s not gonna happen. Also looking forward to new episodes of Homeland. Right now I&#039;m following The Killing s3, not really all that but once I&#039;ve started I must follow through.<br /><br />As for comedy, the first three seasons of Community were pretty, pretty good.

				NBC&#039;s Hannibal.&nbsp; Tells the story of The Silence of the Lambs&#039; Hannibal Lector before he gets ousted as a cannibal, and his patient/protege Will Graham.&nbsp; Really good stuff, especially for network TV.

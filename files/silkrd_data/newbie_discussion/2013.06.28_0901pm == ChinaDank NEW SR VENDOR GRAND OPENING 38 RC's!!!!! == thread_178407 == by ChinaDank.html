				+1 ChinaDank thanks for vending here<br /><br />edit:&nbsp; Got it. Thanks ChinaDank for sending such a generous sample.<br /><br />Shipping was quick and stealthy. Product arrived in the time frame specified on the vendors page. Samples were separately vac&#039;d and the weight was right on point for each one. <br /><br />Methylone pic:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4wy.jpg<br />These are big huge rocks. One weighed a half G by itself<br /><br />4mec pic:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4wc.jpg<br />Wow! Last time I had 4mec it was a white powder. This stuff looks like ice shards.<br /><br />pic of both:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4wm.jpg<br /><br />I&#039;ll be back here in a day or 2 to talk about quality. Looks like we have a new dependable RC vendor. Great job ChinaDank and thanks again<br /><br />2nd edit: The 4mec is amazing quality. Just a tiny amount of the glass crushes into a huge pile to be snorted. It burns going up and has a tasty drip. This stuff puts you on a time table. The first effects are noticeable right away with a strong sense of alertness followed by a lot of euphoria a few minutes later. There&#039;s no real urge to redose. It gives you a ton of energy and keeps you from eating<br /><br />

				This is a Review for a sample of ChinaDank’s&nbsp; Methylone (M1) Rocks.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shipping- 5/5--------- Super Fast Shipping across the world.&nbsp; I ordered it on Monday. The vendor shipped the package on Tuesday. I received my product fallowing week on Friday. So it was 10 days Total International from China to East Coast USA. It was Tracked, so every step it moved, I knew where it was, all the way to the drop spot. Timing of shipping was great, and in the end the USPS does the actual delivery. No signature required, just dropped in the box. Amazing International shipping.<br /><br />Packaging- 5/5-------- Ultra Stealthy Packaging. The products came in tear-proof envelope. The chemicals came in Vacuumed sealed bags, and labelled. Both of bags were inside a large MBB, that had a perfect disguise cover, which would confuse any customs officer. Even if opened by customs it would go right through with no worries. ChinaDank’s packaging shows that he cares about your safety very much. His packaging would make it across the world every time. Its absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Communication- 5/5-------- ChinaDank answered all my questions. He provided me the Tracking Number, the day after of the shipment. This is awesome. He responded to messages within few hours. Vendor is a nice person to communicate and work with. <br /><br /><br />Product Characteristics- 5/5----------&nbsp; The Methylone came in large crystals. The crystals were light pink/clear/cloudy in colour. Taste was bitter, and it had no smell. The M1 rocks crushed up to pure white powder with a bit of pressure. <br /><br />Pictures of Methylone (Left Side)<br />*WARNING*CLEANRET*.<br />http://i1364.photobucket.com/albums/r732/m1m1mdpvpdpv/photo_zpsde087929.jpg<br /><br /><br />Product Quality- 5/5---------Amazing Quality, Strong and Very Clean Methylone. The 5 grams were shared between 10+ people at a party for more than 12 hours. People were doing 125mg dose every 1.5 hours. Some people were not interested at first, but once everyone was hyped up and going, others did finally decide to give it a try. Most enjoyed the Methylone greatly and agreed that it was 95% similar to MDMA. People very happy with the new experience and stayed up all night partying. I had weighted doses piled all over the kitchen counter, So people were re-dosing when they wanted to, and stayed high the whole time.&nbsp; <br />The Methylone causes a lot of Euphoria and the inside light glow louder.&nbsp; The Base of the music sounds super fantastic. It gives so much alertness, energy, and high mood elevation, and is a great stimulant. It gave everyone large pupil dilation, and wide eyes. It makes you want to move around and everyone was talking very fast .<br /><br />&nbsp;Methylone does heat your body and dehydrates constantly, so ice and cold drinks are a must.&nbsp; The cooler the area, the better the high was. The A/C and outside cold winds are a wonderful feeling and just a uplifting high. Smoking weed is a must, and is excellent addition to keep the night live.<br /><br />In conclusion- 5/5---------- This was Amazing Quality Methylone and I would recommend this product to others. If you want Strong, Clean, and High Quality Methylone, then…………….. ChinaDank!!!!............... is the vendor to go to.<br /><br /><br />ChinaDank!!!!!!! Thank You so much for letting me sample your product and write a review. You have a awesome product my friend.<br />

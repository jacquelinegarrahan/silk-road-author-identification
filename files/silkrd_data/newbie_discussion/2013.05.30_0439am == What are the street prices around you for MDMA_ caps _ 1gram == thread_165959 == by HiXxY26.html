				You don&#039;t have to give your exact location but a general area would be nice.<br /><br />Last time I bought a gram it was like $90 and was from a friend.<br />Caps with prob .100mg were $15. <br /><br />SoCal<br />

				Around here it&#039;s hard to find anything that is actual MDMA. Pressed pills are almost always bunk. A point of real molly is typically $20, $15 if you&#039;re lucky. <br /><br />

				Well, I have the cream of the crop stuff you can get from overseas, but recently tried street stuff at ULTRA MIA. It was okay (maybe 40%), but nothing compared to what they are pumping out across the pond.<br /><br />I paid $150 for the gram (in caps). I didn&#039;t want to travel there with my stuff, and was curios to what street quality would be. Since it was a festival where the stuff is everywhere (and usually a bit better), I&#039;d say $100/g and $15/100mg cap. Again though, quality is low compared to what&#039;s out there. Hope this helps.<br /><br />

				10-20 dollars per 100mg is about the going rate here on the east coast.<br /><br />At ultra all my friends where selling methylone, @50 bucks a gram. <br /><br />I sold 50 caps for 400 bucks to the same friend that was knocking off all the m1.<br /><br /><br />Ive been charging anywhere from 80-100 per g lately, south east us.

				The prices that people on here talk about are crazy to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been places where you get four or five 70mg - 120mg pills on the street for $20.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally payed $1,500 - $2,500 for a thousand 80mg - 120mg pills.

				Four or five 70-120mg pills for $20 bucks is roughly $20 per gram... There&#039;s no way any one is selling a gram of pure mdma in the form of five pills for twenty dollars. <br /><br />Maybe if they where buying bricks of mdma, in which case that person would not be selling pills at all.

				back when i was more into it (circa 2006-2010) I would usually pay $10 for a 100 mg cap and 80-100 for a gram. Nowadays where I&#039;m at shit all seems seems to be like $20 per 100 mg and $150-$200 a gram, but i&#039;ve since changed locales from an urban center to a relatively small southeastern university town and i&#039;m pretty sure all the MDMA i see around here that&#039;s of decent quality comes straight from the road, so that would explain the inflated prices.

				Right, <br />&nbsp;So I started browsing around the site looking at all the large scale listings for ketamine, 100g + <br />And noticed a few vendors that were selling their stuff at considerably less than the others. <br />namley:<br /><br />ITALY<br />Drug Ape<br />BULLDOGISTHEBOSS<br /><br />Out of these 3, 2 of them list a huge range of drugs and precursors at amazing prices, all are stock fotos of the products... <br /><br />So I go ahead and place an order with Italy and receive the following:<br /><br />hello friend, thanks for order<br /><br />1) to address here privnote.com<br />2) NUMBER OF TELEPHONE, MOBILE<br />2) please, to finalize<br />3) you have MDMA in stock!<br />4) bottles available, cisono KETROL, KETAMAX, 100MG/10ML<br /><br /><br />I was concerned at having to provide my address unencrypted and a phone number obvs. So I asked for my order cancelled....<br /><br />The conversation went on like this:<br /><br />brother,<br />ok no telephone,<br />why ask why the phone, and one because the courier has wrapped delivery problems, but if you desidere so, ok<br /><br />your order is already ready to be shipped,<br />please give address privnote.com here, because my key does not work<br /><br /><br />--------------------------<br /><br />Hello,<br />Sorry, but If your PGP key does not work this is a very big security risk for me, I cannot Privnote my address. Please cancel my order or I will ask SR admin to do so.<br />ACE<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />brother,<br />but you are, why you are so deficient?<br /><br />for an address, you&#039;re making me cancel order?<br /><br />if you want to send it to me email italy1@tormail.net.<br /><br />your order, tomorrow left for Spain, I have already done it, now you can not say to cancel order<br /><br />doing the right person,<br />thanks<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />brother,<br />then?<br />already had, done,<br />I&#039;m waiting,<br />your<br />&nbsp; address<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Hey:-)<br />no need to fall out. I wont send my address unencrypted, I think its stramge and dangerous for you to ask for phone numbers, and because of this I 100% will not FE. I am a vendor too and I struggle to understand why you would be unable to decrypt my address or why you wanted my phone number. I have contacted support. you cannot have posted my parcel as you clearly do not know my address...<br />please cancel my order.<br />ACE<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />brother,<br />I told you that the phone, do not want, ok<br />just because it was wrapped, customs call for problemicon address, but everything ok<br /><br />ok brother, to show you that I am honest, escrow<br /><br />-----------------------------------------<br /><br />Anyways, in the end the order was cancelled.&nbsp; <br /><br />It´s late and I am tired so I will let you guys draw your own conclusions, look at the 3 sellers listed above. I personally think they are LE, I have no solid proof, but I really think so. <br /><br /><br />I can only speak with the dealings I have had with ITALY, he has shining feedback, but no one on the forums mentions him? :/ The stats and things sold on the Drug Ape account make me inclined to think it is LE also, but had no dealings with him. <br /><br />As for Bulldogistheboss.. Kinda hoping hes not, feedback seems legit, hes really new though. I was hoping to place my order with him. Anyone have any experience<br /><br />ACE

				Those messages from the vendor are irritating to cipher, lol. But seriously, no vendor should be asking for phone number under any circumstances. Not saying the dude is LE, but you did the right thing by canceling the order. And thanks for sharing as well!

				I am fairly certain that LEO would have a better mastery of the English language. So I highly doubt they are LE.<br /><br />Could be a scammer but don&#039;t want to accuse anyone of that without better proof.<br /><br />However, he is acting outside the rules of SR. There is definitely enough flags to be concerned. <br /><br />Could very well be a vendor that just didn&#039;t take the time to learn how to use encryption. But that is a serious security risk. <br /><br />Is he refusing to cancel your order? If so I would bring this to the attention of Sr staff.

				Since I&#039;ve joined this place I been seeing that name pop up quite a bit in drama thread.<br /><br />The last I recall buldog posted someones address publicly. I&#039;d avoid that vendor at all cost if that&#039;s the some one.

				Yeah that sounds pretty fishy, I&#039;ve never seen a drug dealer so eager to sell drugs, I&#039;d think the mindset would be if you don&#039;t want it someone else will buy it fuck it, but damn he sounded persistent lol.

Imagine they shipped you a key of something, thinking they would bust you as soon as it was delivered and somehow when they busted you it wasn&#039;t there.. Then they have royally fucked up big time.<br /><br />That and the fact drugs can kill people, if you OD&#039;ed on drugs that the LE sent you, the press would have a fucking field day with that. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying LE couldn&#039;t be vendors, they might try work their way around the rules and shit. But, it sounds more like this idiot is a scammer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks bro. Glad to see you around, you seem like a cool cat so far. Hope your vending goes well and keep these noobs in check.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you, mate. Same goes to you&nbsp; :)

				Hello, today I just noticed the lack of correspondence dollars / BTC in bottom of the page of Silk Road website, I find it a shame. thank you for it back because this is very helpful to see the direct conversion of the website !<br /><br />My customers ask me now : Why the rates in BTC are constantly changing? 8-(<br />Thank you to &quot;re-put&quot; this gadget for newbies on SR, please<br /><br />oxiD

				Ya...OMG. I referred to the current bit coin rate on my pages. The next drop...I want to invest so to speak. Had I jumped just a couple weeks ago I&#039;d be lfondeling bucks gotten from doubling bit rate. I know I&#039;m a short acting dufus. Now I have to go to Gox just to peek. Darn it. Please bring it back because I&#039;m selfish and currently unwilling to try and understand how this move benefits your SR...not mine. Me? Just the lowly geek lacking skills in the computer age. Man....that methylone is some good shit....kinda helps a appreciate domes manic phase. Go see digitalink.

				It doesn&#039;t make sense NOT to have it. It&#039;s just nice to know without going to other sites to check the rates. And bitcoins do fluctuate a lot so it is incredibly useful.

				I agree, it&#039;s useful to work out prices when you&#039;re too backwards to have prices auto convert to USD also as SR uses a running average (or last I knew they do) to work out the prices and not mtgox&#039;s last sell price it&#039;s useful if the prices have been jumping around recently.

				I vote to bring it back too. I thought it had to do with upgrading to the new tor package. Have to go to another site like MtGox to check the rates. Maybe it&#039;ll force people to use offsite exchanges, but it&#039;s still a pain in the ass.

				Sorry gang, we had to nix it as part of a security audit.&nbsp; It was just a reference for the latest price on mt. gox, so keeping a tab with mtgoxlive.com open should give you an up to the second rate you can use instead.&nbsp; Sorry for the inconvenience.&nbsp; We&#039;ll try to find a way to gather and display this info more securely, but for the time being it isn&#039;t coming back :(

				Came to the forums because I noticed this...Thank you SR for addressing the question of why the BTC conversion reference disappeared from the site.&nbsp; Under the circumstances of security I understand why you had to get rid of the widget but if you can find a way to restore the feature with more security I&#039;m sure much of the community would appreciate it, because having the BTC conversion rate at the bottom of the page is simply nice to have and very useful.

				Uhm...this wouldn&#039;t seem like a challenging issue to fix in a secure way?<br /><br />Simple cron script that queries the current 24 hour floating average price at Mt. Gox, does a little sanity checking on the results, and then stores the value and timestamp in a database. Then, all that needs happen in the footer is a simple sql query to see what the current value is.<br /><br />What&#039;s vulnerable about that?<br /><br />Is the issue that this isn&#039;t being done over tor? Or just a concern that the queries create a pattern vulnerable to traffic analysis? Regardless, probably better to air on the side of security.

No, I don&#039;t think so.<br /><br />The reason China censors the Internet has nothing to do with keeping the workforce working and everything to do with keeping their subjects quiet. It&#039;s politics, not economics.

				Chinese internet isn&#039;t blocked. I order good directly from there on a monthly basis (counterfeit goods). They can access our websites just like we can access there&#039;s. The shipping companys website they use is completely in Chinese but they have an option to view it in English. The people who are working for 10¢ an hour probably don&#039;t have access to the internet or fully well know how much we pay for their good but are either happy to have a job at all or (because of their government) couldn&#039;t do anything about it if they wanted to.

				Not many drugs come from china on the global market. Death penalty for selling on SR for sure. You won&#039;t find much made from there labs either just RC and other designer drugs and grey market chems but not meth or mdma. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t make much sense to sell drugs internationally from china when first the demand domestically would be very low, and second if you did it in another country you wouldn&#039;t be killed if you got caught.

				I keep an eye out for knock off shoes and clothes from china, but only see high priced bag and heels. I&#039;d like bulk of bags, heels, sneakers, for very low price per item. Will keep checking for that..<br /><br />also would love to see counterfeit currency. 200 in false 20&#039;s would be great to see.

				I&#039;ve had a ton of trouble connecting to the site the last couple days. Frustrating cos I just re-upped and want to run an ad, as well as keep an eye on the status of the orders I have out. <br /><br />I frequently refresh my ID, and also restart Tor and Aurora; so I know it&#039;s not just a bad route.. Yesterday I was finally able to get on in the evening for a couple hours, but now again today I&#039;ve been trying for hours and nada.. Anyone else??

				Try using https://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.tor2web.org/&nbsp; &nbsp;instead.<br />Tor2web.org is a Tor web proxy, if you use it in your Tor browser your IP will still be hidden.<br />That&#039;s what I have been doing and it works fine.

				It seems to me that the domain is not propogating across the Tor network. This is my theory. Why? I have no idea. Time for a new domain?

I had to think about that for a second... of course they cant block one site inside Tor Network.. specially if the forums still work. But it is possible, not saying they would, to block the whole Tor Network. Then of course you would have to get a proxy outside the USA to get in... always will be a way around it. (Probably why they aren&#039;t wasting the time to block within it&#039;s borders)

				I got to the login page through the proxy just now, on my first try, not going to log in because tor4web can identify my IP, but it&#039;s still there. It&#039;s been doing this for the last few days btw. Jumping straight to &quot;it&#039;s down for good&quot; is silly.

				I know it isn&#039;t permanent, but this up and down sucks guys. I guess the popularity of this site probably threw SR for a loop, meaning he/she/they had no time to prepare for the sheer number of visitors. But at the same time, if that is the reason, its a positive because it means our little underground economy is slowly but steadily growing. :)

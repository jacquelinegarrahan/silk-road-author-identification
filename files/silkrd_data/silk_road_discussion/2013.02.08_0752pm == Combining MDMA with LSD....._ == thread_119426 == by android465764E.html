				Any thoughts?<br />I&#039;ve read user reports on this saying that out was amazing, others seem to think it was a nightmare. <br /><br />Been munching on crystal mdma all day, now I feel like dropping some acid. <br /><br />Yes? No? etc...

				search around for &quot;candy flipping&quot; here on the forum - that&#039;s what that&#039;s called. I&#039;ve only done it once, but I had an absolute blast. there&#039;s all sorts of stuff on erowid about cross-tolerance and biochemical responses. <br /><br />if you&#039;re a caution-to-the-wind kind of dude, go have fun.

				yeah, pretty sure it propper gear. mdma white crystal, nice and clean, and a baby dose of lsd-25 160ug.<br /><br />So I guess the best thing to do is wait for the lsd to kick-in, before taking the mdma?&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve candy-flipped once and it was a blast. The visual aspect added to the roll is just so euphoric and mind blowing. It is something I really can&#039;t put words to. My experience was with a few other people also candy-flipping and mixing in some ketamine. I took one look around the room and everyone was just so fucking out of it, even the ones not doing any K on top of the MDMA and LSD. One guy knocked the hookah over that we were smoking for this one reason that I will never forget, &quot;Sorry guys, I forgot I had hands and that we were smoking. I was literally stuck in the movie.&quot; Another kid was petting stuff in the closet and sitting backwards in his chair. If you are going to do it, I think the perfect combo is 120-150mg of MDMA and just one tab of acid 100-120 mics, so you are set. Too much acid can put you in a place where you might not want to be, but hey some of you like that kind of shit. Have fun and safe flipping sir.

				I tried this combo once with 300ug LSD (Tessellated) and 200mg MDMA (MarijuanaIsMyMuse).<br /><br />I had a blast for the first 2-3 hours, then I started getting bad vibes from the people I was around and sent me into a bad trip for awhile. It was WAY intense. I had no control over body temp and I was sweating profusely for 5 hours straight. Also had moments in time when I would just kinda blank out and my eyes would roll into the back of my head for minutes at a time. It was a bit worrying. I think it would have been great if I hadn&#039;t started catching bad vibes. Sent me into paranoid mode. Also the over-heating was almost unbearable. Had me wishing I&#039;d done a low dose of molly. SUPER euphoria, though. Never been so high in my life. Craziest visuals ever. Lights looked incredible. Very fast morphing., swirling, and dripping of objects. It was my first time doing ecstasy in about 3 years, as well.

				Candy flipping is the best drug mixture i have tried in my opinion.&nbsp; If you wanna go all out add some shrooms.<br /><br />Best place to trip is at an overnight festival cuz you can bug the fuck out all you want without getting caught and you can explore and run and roll around like a dumbass as much as you want without anyone judging you.&nbsp; haha i cant wait til festi season!!! woot woot!

				50mg K, ten min after dropping the L. Another 50mg an hour in, once the K wears off, you should be peaking from the L, then 100-300mg MDMA( according to your typical dose w.e that may be.) .. then the explosion, then an hour or two of face fuckery. On the come down of the mandy, dose like 5-15mg 2c-b.. all the while smoking as much green as you possibly could.. That is the recipe for an EPIC 12 hours! 8)

Thats kind of the best thing about it, and the reason why i hippy flip at all, cause MDMA alone, for me, is too good. I had a 4 year E binge when i was comming of age, and i had done so much that i swore it off for life.. of coarse that wasnt the case, but i did indeed take a few years off. When you dose molly or E pills, while on L.. there is virtually no come down. Certainly no &#039;wtf am i doing with my life?!? some one please kill me now!!&#039; type feelings. <br /><br />Also if youve been eating molly all day or night, then drop a measly 100-200ugs of LSD, its not likely that it will do what it could, you would indefinitely need to up the L dose, at least 2 or 3 fold. The MDMA reams your serotonin receptors, and if youve done enough in short periods of time, or with out taking some decent time off, it will be hard to feel anything at all, mentally and emotionally speaking.&nbsp;

				Yea dont take A LOT of mdma.&nbsp; The best candyflipping trip you can do is if you mix something from the NBOMe family, my fav is 25i and 25c, those i have realized are more intense than the others and makes LSD look like childs play.&nbsp; Well mix that with a Red ? those things are amazing, a lot better than any powder/crystal molly ive ever had.&nbsp; Do this (at a festival cuz you shouldnt do this on the streets lol) and your in for the trip of your mother fucking life! <br />I personally dont like tripping inside because when you trip somewhere you dont already have memorized the trip is so much more meaningful and adventurous.&nbsp; If your lets say in your room once you begin to trip your mind automatically fights the trip and tries to make sense of your surroundings my memory thus ruining the trip.&nbsp; Plus the brain always wants to compare your memory to what your seeing at the moment

				I did 25mg of 2c-e combined with an 800ug 25i tab, and once these were on the solid come up I pop 200mg of methylone. <br /><br />That turned out to be pretty hectic.

I believe LSD makes NBOMe look like childs play. NBOMe is nowhere near as diverse as LSD and does not give you a &#039;rounded&#039; experience. <br /><br />That&#039;s just my opinion though. NBOMe has its place and is fun, but it will never replace LSD.

				DenoyerGeppert, come to think of it, yea your right, ive never tripped off the NBOMe fam the same way i did on lsd, but thats comparing 2 tabs or lsd to 1 tab of 25i or 25c.&nbsp; Last time i tried LSD was about 2 months ago, i dunno if my friend got screwed cuz i did trip but nothing crazy.. just very giggly and some things were a lil wavy... I have double dipped tabs, when i try one i might change my mind since i dont trust other ppls shit except mine.&nbsp; <br />

				Nbome&#039;s are a roll of the dice. Everyone seems to have different base tolerances and different reactions. I took about 1200-2000 ug of 25i (seller claimed 1mg but reviews claimed weaker) and had a very visual trip, probably the visual equivalent of 300ug of lsd, but very little headspace and mental loops. A friend took two of the same tabs and had a very mental trip with little visuals until he mixed it with some cannabis. You just never really know. <br /><br />Mixing different types is a unique idea (and cheap) though I&#039;d be worried about vaso-constriction but I suppose one could counteract that with some vasodilator. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">DenoyerGeppert, come to think of it, yea your right, ive never tripped off the NBOMe fam the same way i did on lsd, but thats comparing 2 tabs or lsd to 1 tab of 25i or 25c.&nbsp; Last time i tried LSD was about 2 months ago, i dunno if my friend got screwed cuz i did trip but nothing crazy.. just very giggly and some things were a lil wavy...

Not quite a micro-dose because there were noticeable effects but not strong enough to do much. Once got some that I think weren&#039;t laid evenly and it did pretty much the same thing while others said they were tripping balls.

It&#039;s making me consider majoring in chem so I can then order all the precursors I need off the road and start making a personal supply myself.

A lot of people on the road seem to be outraged they&#039;re paying more than $5 sometimes. They don&#039;t get that we aren&#039;t in the 60&#039;s anymore and the amount of lsd has dropped off significantly.

				Yes, its said the Magnesium sups will prevent, or greatly reduce the jaw tension , when taken just before dosing. Ive also yet to try some, cause my jaw dont get too bad.. not so much to where its an issue, I just chew the inside of my mouth a bit, kind of enjoy it to be honest LOL

Subtle effects still, but definitely gonna try bigger doses next time. Mdma was a lovely combo. Took the anxiety edge right off. Was all over by 4am though.

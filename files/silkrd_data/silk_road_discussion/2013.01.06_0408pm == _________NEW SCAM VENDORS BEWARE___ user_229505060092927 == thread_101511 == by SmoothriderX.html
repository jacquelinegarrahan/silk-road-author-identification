				Received this this morning:<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Well, it&#039;s that time you knew was coming, we caught you. I&#039;m the guy in charge of watching vendors to prevent them finding customers on our site, and then completing the transaction(s) outside our site to avoid paying our commission. Sadly, that&#039;s exactly what you&#039;ve been doing.<br /><br />Obviously it is against our rules to sell your product to customers you find here outside of our system to avoid our fees. It costs a lot to run and maintain this site, and you are fucking us buy cheating us out of our small percentage.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been working about 70 hours a week for the past year to keep this site operating, so when I see someone cheating us, I get upset.<br /><br />But, today may be your lucky day. I don&#039;t get paid much for my work, and I&#039;m in some financial trouble, so if it&#039;s worth it to you, I&#039;ll make you a deal.<br /><br />You send me 500 Bitcoins in the next 72 hours, and I don&#039;t contact Dread right now and have you banned from this site. I have all the evidence saved, don&#039;t bother deleting your PMs etc. If I do this, not only will you lose your seller account tonight, but all of us will watch to make sure you and your crew never get another seller account here again.<br /><br />That&#039;s it.<br /><br />I will never check the account I&#039;m sending this message from again, so don&#039;t bother trying to threaten, negotiate, or whatever. If it&#039;s worth 500 Bitcoins for you to keep using our market, then you&#039;ll pay. If not, go back to the streets.<br /><br />If I see 250 bitcoins sent within 72 hours, I will give you another 10 days to get the other 250 BTC sent to me.<br /><br />I&#039;m the guy who monitors vendors, so if I get the coins, I will watch your account and make sure you don&#039;t get heat for off-site sales. I&#039;ll give you an email, and you can contact me with any problems you need handled by an admin. I&#039;ll also punch your listings to a lot of people&#039;s front pages.<br /><br />One year from now, we will talk about another fee for me.<br /><br />If the coins don&#039;t arrive at that address within 72 hours, you will be banned from this site and you guys will never be allowed to sell here or on our new sites again.<br /><br />Here is the address to pay the 500 BTC: 1CcjVfMN1PanTVBszDe1CuJ6bn9rQkiVpc<br /><br /><br />Sorry for being a prick, but you owe us, so I really don&#039;t feel bad. This will be good for both of us.

				lol, what a joke - self-made-mafia for or from the poor ones... ;D<br />I really laughed a lot when I just read this. <br />It´s up to you, of course, if&nbsp; you take this serious, or maybe even start a counter-attack ;-)...

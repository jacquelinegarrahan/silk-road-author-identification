				Dr. Zakir Naik - Quran &amp; Modern Science. <br />Its a very interesting lecture about like the title says. The Quran and Modern Science. <br /><br />PS truly unbiased does not exist because every person will present a subject/concept from his own experience knowledge point of view.

				Then please forgive me for my wrong assumptions.<br />If you compare curtain religion and the way of life the preach. There are some differences between them. <br />And there right context is always most always be observed.<br />But the problem is that most if not all religions preach a way of life with the goal of achieving ultimate succes in the after life.

				Fight or flight is an animal human instinct and part of human nature. And that will never change. <br />Because how ever you at it form the point of evolution or religion. How ever you look upon it <br />we are glorified monkey&#039;s. So the human basic instinct will in some way will drive us.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				&quot;Zen and The Art of Archery&quot; by Eugen Herrigel (that&#039;s pronounced oygen, not yoojeen)<br /><br />It&#039;s relevant to anybody who is trying to master a challenging skill.<br /><br />edit -- It&#039;s also the book that gave rise to all the &quot;Zen and Whatever Wankery I&#039;m Into&quot; books all over the bestseller lists.

				Literature:<br /><br />Free Will - Sam Harris<br />&nbsp; - chances are you believe that you are the author of your own thoughts and actions. this is not even remotely as true as you believe it to be. Sam Harris lays out a devastatingly clear and concise (&lt; 100 pages!) explanation as to why that is, what it means, and especially what it doesn&#039;t mean. <br /><br />Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert Pirsig<br />&nbsp; - this gets pretty dense on the philosophy, but the experience of reading it is sublime<br />&nbsp; - this book changed me. it was slow, and it did not *fix* me, but it absolutely changed me<br /><br />Catcher in the Rye - J.D. Salinger<br />&nbsp; - i cry every time i read this, and it&#039;s always on the same page<br />&nbsp; - this is a book everyone should read at least once every 10 years<br /><br />100 Years of Solitude - Gabriel García Márquez<br />&nbsp; - one of the most beautiful experiences I&#039;ve ever read<br />&nbsp; - there will be flying carpets within the first 100 pages, and you will believe they are real<br /><br />Movies:<br /><br />Where The Wild Things Are<br />&nbsp; - this movie got a lot of shit, and none of it was deserved. it is brutally (but metaphorically) honest about growing up and learning to deal with the monsters of desire that most people are most of the time. <br />&nbsp; - this is NOT a kids movie<br /><br />Apocalypto<br />&nbsp; - just ... fuck yeah<br /><br />2001: A Space Odyssey<br />&nbsp; - fuckin Kubrick man. You owe it to yourself to drop acid and watch this movie.<br />&nbsp; - DO NOT spoil this movie for yourself by reading the plot.<br />&nbsp; - it&#039;s too soon to tell, but I&#039;m pretty sure this movie changed my life.

				I found Albert Hoffman&#039;s book &quot;LSD My Problem Child&quot; to be a really interesting read.<br /><br />Talks about discovering LSD, how he felt about it being used recreationally, studying it and then also exploring Mexico and South America in a quest to isolate psilocibin.

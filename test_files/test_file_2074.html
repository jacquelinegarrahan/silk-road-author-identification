    So u aussies talk to much publicly. LE, customs and postal services seem to be cracking down/having win? NO MORE
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Time to take a breather from that shit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have done fair amount of bizness on SR and have something to offer, its time to expect a tap on your shoulder. Venodors and longtimers- respect. PLease take the lead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Help each brother out. Invite those you can vouch for. Share legit vendors and success rates. Name and shame those that have dodged you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep it to PM.  Share information. Discuss, debate, but above all BE SMART.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    90% of those that make $ on here and who are effective, do so in Stealth. LE can only 'watch' you and take an interest to that which they can observe. Time to go underground (of the already underground).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SKYY boasted 'border proof' so how did LE react, WITH FORCE and they won.
    <br/>
    Then their attention moved to Germany, namely PF: and who could blame then, I mean cmon just look at his revew thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    No more making pointless threads. Shutdown those that do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets be smart with who we invite. Stats and cred and good judge of character is required. Most of the time LE stand out, but keep on your toes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets keep this PM 'group circle' active.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whose in?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I nominate:Limitless, Somebloke (me!), Cozmo, Ausguy, Sara, Matrix, PaddyMiller, hoffa, yellow, 403kmnd, gimmesom. MychemicalRomance, hashmat, syrinx, kigpin, ozzybattla, gionzoxx, kraziel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anybody else want in/ or shouldnt be on the list?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Will create PM dist'n list soon upon confirmation from those wanting in, and whether y'all think its a good idea!

    Also, there's way too many variables to get anywhere near a good results from a thread like this.
    <br/>
    Fairly sure it's be done over and over and over in different forms, too.

    Seen it in the first oz thread, 2nd, and many many separate threads.

    well i just keeping on making posts, asking questions etc. and either ger flamed for talking about something publicly or my post/questions gets lost in the noise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hey 49 posts, u gotta start somewhere. I have bought RC's for 5+ years, and on here 3+ months. I know a thing or 2. I have friends in customs as well as postal system.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But I what I have liked, and taken me by surprise is occasionally i get some very helpful PM's from some other aussies telling me what they have learnt and who they have had success with and just generally sharing stats/info. these are gold in my opinion and form the true basis of the 'community'. Not the meth heads who have just received latest 8 ball shards, smoked up and all of a sudden they know the secrets to free energy and willing to write 12 pages on the topic. Just like minded SR users who would rather discuss ideas, ask questions, share info out of the way of the public eye (and purge the overcrowded forums of aussie newb threads). Drug taking and SR is not my full time job, I'm pretty successful outside of year, so excuse me for not bumping up my posts talking shiz.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like to order qual recreational chems for my selected crew, organise weekends away where everyone chips in for accommodation and 'lets themselves go for a weekedn away from the rat race and the hustle of day to day life'. And boy do they need it/love it. Its what I'm known for and when i org something, everyone accepts invition and gets excited. I wanna cxontinue this, just finding with my minimal time avaialble on here, there is beginning to be just too much junk to sift through, and starting top be scammed a bit too often.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So thats what I i'm aiming to attract. I useful 'crowd'' that responds and makes an effort for those involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If u not interested and u think it wont work, fine. Its opt in.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PM if yur in. I'll add you to the list and forward on a collection of all the useful contributions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THanks to the 5 who have already done so. Exepect replies soon!!

    Sounds like a great idea. Bloody LE everywhere on here these days though. Like others have said, it might be hard to filter out potential LEO infiltrating the private PM thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, as long as it doesn't contain any more info than what would already be included in the numerous (too numerous) aussie threads, then it could be a winner.  I'm interested.

    Suuuure mate - why don't people just send you exact pictures of the packaging? You'll pay a BTC reward for good info? What the fuck is someone importing 2 gees of MDMA going to want with your 2 bitcoins. Get the fuck out.

    I don't post much on here anymore, partly to stay as anonymous as possible and partly because 90% of the Aussie threads are SPAM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The quicker everyone learns that we are 100% alone on here (unless you have IRL friends on here) in this SR project the better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is no way to know who to trust.......    Trusting regular/high post count aliases based on the amount of time they spend on here is silly.  Some of the more prolific posters on here are the most suspicious in my book. Personally, I don't trust mods anymore than anyone else.  Why?  Think about it....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only relatively safe way to use SR is for personal amounts sent to a clean or mostly clean address,  PGP,  good bitcoin buying practices, no more than one or two orders at a time, research vendors and chose carefully - cheaper isn't usually better,  STFU on  phone/txts/email, and to be prepared for anything that LE might throw at you even though it is unlikely that they will do so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, more people not getting packages doesn't mean that customs are winning if 10x more people are ordering than 12 months ago. It is always a % game  and this conclusion is in the media straight from the horses mouth for anyone to read.
    <br/>

    Do your own research and follow your instincts.

    It would be IMPOSSIBLE to filter LE out. You would end up with LE in the loop and you're right back where you started. Then the danger would be that your LE moles would have access to the info that this supposedly elite group were sharing, like who the most successful members are (including stealth operators - if there are any), what kind of packaging they are using, etc (which is why OP sounds like he's a COP!)

    I agree totally. The only way to safely use SR is to assume every person you are dealing with is LE (in reality thats obviously not the case, the majority of us are people just looking to score), however that is the mind set you need to have to stay safe. Buyers are obviously safer than vendors, as LE will be mainly focused on identifying vendors. How would LE go about gathering info about vendors? They would do a bunch of things. Pose as legit buyers, make purchases and see what info they can glean from packaging (quite a lot actually, especially if vendors are using express post). How else? Think about it, a group of users that actually included vendors, privately discussing the best vendors, their techniques and products. That would be a prime target for LE. They would make getting access to that info a priority. Meaning if I was a vendor I would stay well clear of said group.
    <br/>
    I think the smart vendors trust no one: not one of their buyers, not their regulars and certainly not some group of 'trusted' users.

    I agree, just use vendor review threads and report on your transactions: did your package arrive, how quickly, was the packaging suitably stealthy? (no need for details), was the product good quality.

     Amended cybercrime bill passes Senate
     <br/>
     August 22, 2012 3:08PM
     <br/>
     PHONE carriers will soon have to store text messages, emails and other data to help police fight cybercrime.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Government legislation that will allow the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and foreign law enforcement agencies to seek communications data under warrants cleared the Senate on Wednesday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The bill allows for increased co-operation between local and overseas cybercrime investigators, extends the scope of existing Commonwealth computer offences and brings Australia into line with the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Attorney-General Nicola Roxon hailed the passage of the bill.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "This will help combat criminal offences relating to forgery, fraud, child pornography and infringement of copyright and intellectual property," she said in a statement.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During the Senate debate on Wednesday, Australian Greens senator Scott Ludlam raised concerns about stored data being given to foreign countries for use in criminal cases involving the death penalty.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But cabinet minister Joe Ludwig argued the federal police had strict guidelines about the level of co-operation it provides to foreign agencies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Senator Ludlam argued there was a need for laws to catch up on technological developments so authorities could net tech savvy cyber criminals, however, privacy protection should not be completely sacrificed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He pointed to the location data from mobile phones as an area in need of privacy safeguards.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Opposition legal affairs spokesman George Brandis said Senator Ludlam's concerns about privacy were laughable because he was a key supporter of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who had published thousands of diplomatic cables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In doing so Assange had disregarded the privacy of those mentioned in the cables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Senate passed government amendments to address 12 out of 13 recommendations from the joint select committee on cyber-safety, covering privacy protections and assistance to foreign agencies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The amended Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 will go back to the lower house for approval.

    cos pretty much as i see it the only (best/guaranteed) mdee source after recent turn of event (last 3-5 months) is what supertrips offer. all others offer no escrow, no guarantee, and dont really give a fuck about aussies. we are purely scamm material.

    i bought from pf a few times without hitch before he EXPLODED in populairty and then i never saw ONE aussie receive from then on. My guess is he didnt even bother with us/small orders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    $2k is a bit to lay out and can defs get u in trouble if u get caught. my previous max EVER was 10 grams. U would still get seriously in trouble if they controlled delivered to you. But still 10gm can fit in a nomral size business envelope so really should be as easy as 1gram.

    Pro-tip: just to help you out a little bit, and try to make it so that you're not INCREDIBLY outsmarted by pretty much everybody here (I don't think it's fair to fight someone who's at such a HUGE disadvantage) - you need to tone your shit down a bit if you're trying to blend in. The veiled praise you were heaping on your peers' 'success' in stopping incoming shipments, in your first post, is hilarious! It actually made me laugh out loud. Not even kidding. They really need to school you guys a little better.

    Pride, as misplaced as it may be, is the number one cause of intelligence agent's cover being blown. This mainly applies to Americans who are all "FUCK YYYYYEEEAAAAHH 'MURRICAAAA!" but it's clear that pride in failure is also an Australian officer habit.

      cos pretty much as i see it the only (best/guaranteed) mdee source after recent turn of event (last 3-5 months) is what supertrips offer. all others offer no escrow, no guarantee, and dont really give a fuck about aussies. we are purely scamm material.

      i bought from pf a few times without hitch before he EXPLODED in populairty and then i never saw ONE aussie receive from then on. My guess is he didnt even bother with us/small orders.

      $2k is a bit to lay out and can defs get u in trouble if u get caught. my previous max EVER was 10 grams. U would still get seriously in trouble if they controlled delivered to you. But still 10gm can fit in a nomral size business envelope so really should be as easy as 1gram.

      Anyway, fuckstick, now I have explained myself  IN PUBLIC, I have gone against everything I was attempting to counter with this idea/thread.

      <br/>
      read all my posts. lol if u think i'm LE. you can pretty much angle anyone as LE if u read what u want/looking.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Heck I could say YOU ARE LE AS YOU ARE TRYING TO SHUT DOWN A GOOD IDEA THAT WOULD HIDE SHIT FROM YOU. YEH KEEP EVERYTHING IN OPEN SO WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERP DERP.

     I'm not one to normally call people out as being law enforcement officers, but seriously, you are so blatantly obvious. And I mean REALLY.. Even my blind dead grandmother, with no head, could see through you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pro-tip: just to help you out a little bit, and try to make it so that you're not INCREDIBLY outsmarted by pretty much everybody here (I don't think it's fair to fight someone who's at such a HUGE disadvantage) - you need to tone your shit down a bit if you're trying to blend in. The veiled praise you were heaping on your peers' 'success' in stopping incoming shipments, in your first post, is hilarious! It actually made me laugh out loud. Not even kidding. They really need to school you guys a little better.
     <br/>
     Pride, as misplaced as it may be, is the number one cause of intelligence agent's cover being blown. This mainly applies to Americans who are all "FUCK YYYYYEEEAAAAHH 'MURRICAAAA!" but it's clear that pride in failure is also an Australian officer habit.

    I REALLY DONT FUCKING CARE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME. Why are u in this thread. I have an hour a day after work on here, donet need innernet high fives from anonymous losers like yourselfand have made many orders from 10-20 vendors on here. Check my review stats. All of these vendors even know my home address and if u googled that shit you can see my car out the front. Its a hotted up police issue commodore with pursuit rims and way fatser than any hyundai excel u drive cos u spend all yur $ on crack.

    I could easily prove to your through a million diff ways/reasons i'm not LE. i'm a computer programmer/sys engineer by trade and know shit loads about cypto and all hings nerdy. BUt fuck it why am i still defending myself , "the lady doth protest too much"

    And u dumb cunts who think u can read between the lines and 'detect' a hint of LE rhetoric or whatever.

    well its hard trying to figure out whats best: be totally open like many in this thread want (and prob what LE would prefer) ie. in vendor reviews, should we say we're aussie??
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or try like hell to keep public sp[specifics to a minimum publically, but hassle vendors for stats or ask for advice via PM. i've tried it all and got flamed no matter what.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT what I can tell u HAS worked (and by surprise) is other aussies PM'ing me randomly with some good info about what they have/havent gotten and who to try and/or bad experiences.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, all with a pinch (bag) of salt. Look past the info offered up for any such motivation (maybe vendor trying to promote? maybe fuzz? maybe a fellow legit SR dude buzzing n bored and wanting to share the PLUR).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So that last part is up to you and your skills, experience on here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    THanks all for your PM's. Have read and will get back to you all in time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have no current orders so havent been so active on here, and there is bulk local quality gear on streets too at mo (wtf with the major price drop in kuda shards from local supplies?? smokes like no other. thick PLUMES. must be some huge shipment landed on our shores recently. 3 diff dealers who i hardly bother with have been msg'ing me at all hours pushing the shit at way reduced prices- havent seen that in Oz for, welll ever!!!). Maybe LE, customs have relaxed in the wrong areas! get to it boys!!!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I''ll keep up the research game and keep in touch with those on the list. Once i got some deece heads together i'll see how  we can network the crew. Like for best speed contacts msg 'blah blah'. best for MDEE talk to blah blah, psychadelics = blah blah and scripts blah blah. Or something. I have no idea. Just didnt want to spew forth adding to the constant drivel from Aussies to any/all threads they think shouting loudly from will maybe get them a hit\response.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    BUT yeh, WELL AWARE it takes just ONE mole/LE to fuck the whole idea up. So give me time, may even give up on the idea all together. Just want something better for us Aussies.

    So I ordered a g of ketamine and a g of molly from a vendor a little while back and it fucking came in a flat rate box with just the crack sack inside each time. How can vendors still be getting five of five when disregarding customers safety like this. I know it was just a g but still like I would have made larger orders if this guy didn't ship like he didn't give a fuck about repeat business. I am worried about changing my feedback after all the threats people have been receiving though. What do u guys think I should do. Change feedback or toss his name out on here?

    I'm a bit undecided on this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know nearly nothing about molly or ketamine, but do they smell? I don't believe they do, at least not as bad as the dank round these woods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was domestic, I think that may be borderline sufficient because they have no right to open your mail without a warrant. I'd be more concered with the outside looking legit because that's what the postman is restricted to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it was international then well...yeah you might want to consider everything you typed because customs can open "suspicious" mail without warrant as far as I know.

    In my books not good enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Politely PM the vendor and ask them to add more stealth to their packages.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they tell you where to get off then find a new vendor. It's not worth the risk is it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they threaten you open a ticket with SR support.
    <br/>

    The name of this game is security. Everything has to be watertight to minimise the risk of LE sticking their piggy noses into your business. When people accept less than the best is when people get sloppy, and when people get sloppy they get nicked and do time.

    if its domestic i'm ok with g orders being just inside the envelope. if they include a thick piece of paper to put the g in so you cant feel the baggy. domestic letters just slide through. the closer they look to a regular thin mail envelope the better. i'm more concerned with the addresses being written correctly and readable. i prefer it when they use a typed label.

    i would not publicly put a vendors name on the forum without talking to them first about it, especially if you ever want to deal with them again lol if you tell them you dont feel comfortable with there packaging, i think a good vendor would try to stealth it better next time. if the guy says no he doesnt have the time to pack items better then change your feedback accordingly and dont buy from them again.

    It is unfortunate. Some compatriots of mine and myself were having tea in the Captain's quarters discussing that we feel as if vendors are disproportionately in power - bear me out in this thinking.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. It is not readily easy to make oneself insulated from a vendor.
    <br/>
    -False identities are easily procurable but legitimate functioning addresses attached to a false identity? No, these are difficult and costly to come by. Many small time purchasers would ideally like such a set up as it gives the same anonymity that a vendor has but it can be costly or massively time consuming or a combination of those two aforementioned statisticals.
    <br/>
    2. Vendor's have created the blacklist
    <br/>
    -I have personally seen and/or experienced vendors that readily threaten the dreaded vendor's blacklist. What would happen if perfect stats were marred by such a convention? An unfortunate turn of sequences we can be assured. A buyer must then start from scratch, having to learn to love again  as it were. Once you've caught your wife(vendor) cheating it is hard to rebuild trust in her once more.
    <br/>
    3. Buyer's vote with their dollar but loyalties are mixed
    <br/>
    -A good experience with one buyer and one vendor does not guarantee a good experience for the next buyer with the same vendor. We all know this. A vendor has selectivity in his dealings. As buyers also has this ability but the problem has always been that buyers have been divided. Buyers do not form groups, though they could, buyer's clubs of sorts. We have also seen claims of selective scamming though I think that in those cases the buyer probably got selectively scammed because they were annoying and not respectful in which case the selective scamming, if it indeed did happen, was well deserved and subtle way of telling that particular buyer "You're an asshole".
    <br/>
    4. We should really form a buyer's club
    <br/>
    -Though I have no idea how it would be implemented and what if any benefit there would be from it. Group purchases would be possible but I can only imagine the nightmare that would result. Someone would surely be crying foul because people tend to be whiny bitches.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Original poster, you bring up good points about stealth and feedback. Someone once hilariously mused on these very forums that they were tired of seeing feedback such as:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5/5 Cocaine was as dry as wall plaster, immediately clogged and lodged in my nostrils upon insufflation, cocaine came mailed in a clear plastic bag with a bright red label affixed which plainly stated "Cocaine" and it took 9 weeks for product to arrive after marked in-transit. Worst transaction I've yet experienced.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is true though. As an experienced buyer I have felt hesitation about leaving anything less than a five. There have been instances where I have been shorted product yet I refuse to request a single refund for I will NOT tarnish mine perfect statisticals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If our buyer stats are equivalent to our real world credit scores, then the man with the refund is the unemployed nigger demanding a home loan at the bank.

    There's a lot of truth to that; I would +1 if it weren't for the racism at the end and some over-dramaticized wife/lover commentary.  In general, I doubt many buyers form any real relationships with their vendors due to anonymity and desire to just be done and high.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is a pressure to leave 5/5s; a lot of vendors specifically say that leaving any less will result in consequences.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't think there's anything we can do about it aside from to not use said vendor.  The users still have the most power as a collective; some good slander on the forums will definitely kill a vendor's sales (see TheTopShelf).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ultimately, we are giving them addresses, so we have to be careful with our dealings to ensure we don't incite any that could pose a potential IRL danger.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The forums seem to be a lot more honest of a place due to added anonymity.

    yes chriscalderon i agree with a lot of what your saying, good post +1 but could have done without racist slang at the end -1
    <br/>
    a buyers club would be interesting. i was already thinking about something like that to buy in bulk to save money. not sure how it would work because everyone would have to give there money to 1 person to pay. thats alot of risk. plus paying for a ton of shipping fees. its something to ponder though

    Excuse the crassness Rob, PS have you watched the fourth season of Arrested Development? I've tried but its just not clicking with me for some reason. PM me and let me know your opinions of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As far as a buyer's club....I was thinking along the lines of a vendor is told the user names of all participants or SR could have a function on the Vendor's page where a buyer's club is being assembled, one could click an option linking themselves to a club if they choose and then the vendor only releases the order once all users linked to that little group have put in their money, there could be a timer on this so that a buyer's club is punished if their members do not come through, much like vendor's have so long to mark from processing to in transit before an order can be cancelled - I am thinking that a lot of this would be features built in as functionality into SR rather than it being something done outside of the site but it could be a pain either way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And then there is the issue of shipping which you brought up....How would shipping fees be distributed? What happens if someone living close to shipper receives shipment quickly  and someone on other side of country or in different country has to wait several weeks? How would buyer feedback be distributed? Would it be weighted since several people are leaving feedback as one or would it be seen as individuals leaving feedback?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Many questions, none of which address terrible stealth. But it is a fun idea to ponder and it may one day become a full fledged function?

    The greatest danger of a badly packed shipment falls on the vendor. If the postal inspectors find out what's in that package they'll get a rough idea of where the vendor is operating (the only exception would be the rare case of a vendor who mails his shipments far away from where he lives, but that doesn't happen often).
    <br/>
    So it might help to start out by reminding your vendor that it's in his best interests to use a little more care when breaking the law.
    <br/>
    I don't know when this 5/5 pressure started but I don't pay too much attention to vendor ratings anymore.  A better measure of how a vendor is doing can be found in forum comments.  Yes, sock puppet accounts can create misleading comments, but I've found that, overall, vendor research on the forums pays off.

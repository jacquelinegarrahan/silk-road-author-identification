    First let me say that I have mad respect for vendors and all the hassle they must go through processing so many orders. I understand that they want to get paid ASAP. However, from the buyer's perspective, it is nice to have a as accurate idea as possible of when our packages will arrive.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had it happen twice now that a vendor has marked my order In Transit just a couple hours after I place the order, between like 1 - 3am. I realize time zones vary, but this is US to US. There's no way it's early enough somewhere else in the US to go to the post office. Only thing I can think that would make this true is if they're just dropping it in a box or something?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, I'm curious from the vendor's perspective what your opinion is of this/why you do it? From my fellow buyer's perspective: Anyone else get a little nervous when they notice this? It just bothers me because I get nervous that the vendor will mark In Transit and then not really mail the next day, just let it sit for awhile. I feel like that's what happened with my first couple orders cause it's taking a lot longer than expected. Do I have any reason to be annoyed here or am I just being overly critical?

    Vendors will probably do this for one of two technical reasons -
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It means the buyer can't cancel and (if decent vendor) they can continue to pack orders without the risk of having a buyer cancel = wasted packaging &amp; time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2am may be their "work" time IDK and they pack your order then with intention of sending in the morning without having to log back on later to mark as sent

    I never mark in transit until it is actually in transit. When I confirm shipment at 2am I just got home late.

    This was only a couple hours after I put my order in, not the next night. That would make more sense to me if it was the next night, but this was the same night. I believe I ordered around 10pm, it was marked In Transit at 2am or something like that.

    Ive always just assumed this meant the vendor was a night owl like me and that they probably just printed out labels and packaged orders for the day with intenions to ship them out in the morning.  The orders have always shown up, so it's never made me nervous or anything.

    Some of the vendors I've purchased from mark as "in transit" before it actually gets shipped. I assume this is only to get the clock started towards the 17 days it might take to get their coins (auto-finalize).

    I haven't researched Express, but as long as it fits and its under 13 oz., why not? Unless usps has a rule against it? I don't use express, so I'm not sure.

    My suspicion was warranted. I just got my very first order today. Dude had marked it in transit early in the morning 9/21 or 9/22. Apparently he fucked around for over a week cause it was postmarked 9/30. Still waiting on 4 other orders, who knows if those were shipped. I sure hope so...

    What kind of vacuum sealers do Silk Road sellers use? I've had some things shipped in cool foil pouches, but I don't think I've ever seen that type of sealer commercially available.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not a seller yet, but that's something that I'd definitely want to invest in, should I choose to become one.

    MOST mylar bags(what you would call "foil pouches") can be sealed with any short of heat source. Be it iron, straightner, impact sealer, or even the seal feature on your vaccuum sealer for bags that are less thick.

    Not sure why you would say that. They are perfect for a color barrier. For any substance that could be detected, I would only use it as an exterior bag.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (And IMHO thickness of barrier &gt; vacuum seal any day. Though there are plenty of people here who would argue with me on that point.)

        MOST mylar bags(what you would call "foil pouches") can be sealed with any short of heat source. Be it iron, straightner, impact sealer, or even the seal feature on your vaccuum sealer for bags that are less thick.

      Not sure why you would say that. They are perfect for a color barrier. For any substance that could be detected, I would only use it as an exterior bag.

      (And IMHO thickness of barrier &gt; vacuum seal any day. Though there are plenty of people here who would argue with me on that point.)

    Pretty easy to put a label on it to make whatever item inside seem like a completely legit product. It's all about how you package it. Have you not seen some of the stealth from your fellow vendors?

    LOL you will get nowhere fast thinking that putting a label on something like that and saying "Not for human consumption" is gunna do anything to deter customs from checking your shit. If you think like that then you should maybe go to the RC forums. Also vacuum sealing is better because it masks the smell better than using heat-seal mylar. If you want it thicker you just double vacuum seal it.

    You think I'm that dense? I'm not talking about any of the "Not for human consumption" bullshit. People buy LEGAL items that are powders, rocks, chucks, plant matter, etc. All it takes is a little bit of thinking, and some ingenuity, and you can make your packages LOOK and FEEL like what you are claiming them to be. Understand now?

    Better than wrapping a bag in paper and slapping in an envelope, at the very least.

    Moisture-barrier bag heat sealers can be easily found on ebay and in several commercial outlets. I think I saw them at a warehouse store last month. They are $100 or less.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sealers are very commonly used in food processing, where these bags are becoming ubiquitous. 5mm minimum width, but I prefer the 10mm more as I mess with these.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the question is radiographic quality of the bag, depending on how your package is presented, a MBB may be 100% congruent with the contents.
    <br/>
    If external handling's appropriate,  it's very unlikely to be hit on the line review by a dog if there's *any* kind of timeliness to the shipping if it's in an appropriately sealed MBB. Same's not necessarily true with plastic, where your clock is ticking down quickly. Yes, multilayer is better than single layer, but the *MBB trumps multilayer plastic* and buys you days of safety margin (and, depending on the initial plastic, may just be the right barrier in the first place.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They can't hold your mail for a prolonged period for inspection, but they can for a little bit. Time is the enemy as far as permeation - see Shannon's link, the graphs are blindingly clear and linear.
    <br/>
    That extra day (quite a bit more, it seems, with the MBB) is worth a lot in that particular situation.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    back to heatsealers: you can seal your bag and then put it, as FarmerBob has pointed out, underwater to test the seal.
    <br/>
    If you don't feel good about putting it underwater, it maybe wasn't ready to ship. ;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you review FarmerBob's posts, he has good material on this.

    Quite concerning with mdma: it appears that it's mainly perfumery precursors that the dogs are being trained with, putting into question the reliability of a dog for searches: there's a strong risk of the dog "alerting" to a perfume/cologne, a residue which isn't all that uncommon.  How many unreasonable searches occur because of this? Convince a judge that false positives are a real threat to privacy and a dog's alerting ability may be put into further question. Although a dog may be accepted by the courts, that doesn't mean they're all well-trained, call into question their training record. Sniffer dogs don't work in a world where things are either drug or 100% inert, but they sure are trained in one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess pressed pills (or pressed anything) will give off less VOCs than powders come to think of it. The harder the press, the less volatiles that will be given off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Similarly, acetic acid appears to be a large part of the signature for heroin, so just sprinkle some alkaline substance (calcium carbonate?) in between your vacuum seals and the acetic acid should just neutralize on contact and not evaporate?

    Go to walmart and buy the most expensive vacuum sealer its called a foodsaver or foodsealer I forget which one. Its $150. Then use it until you use up all the free bags included in the package and return it then get another one so you never pay for bags. I suggest sparing no expense for a vaccum sealer the cheap ones suck and the expensive ones are OK at best. But at least using this method you get free bags and you always have the advantage of using a sealer thats brand new. You can keep the sealer for as long as 15 days. I usually return at the 14 day mark but I have waited as long as 2 hours before the 15 day mark.

    Good threat, OP. I was thinking of posting this but came across yours. I definitely know that the cheapy sealers are shit. I am looking for a legitimate sealer that would be proper for sealing numerous substances cannabis, shrooms, and maaaybe heroin. I would really like to know a specific model/brand that is used with great success. Limitless really seems to have his shit together on this. I see that he said just get one that isn't cheap, spend the money necessary to get a legitimate sealer, but is there a specific brand that I should look for, or stay clear of? Any specifics on brand and or model from anyone would be greatly appreciated.

    If you are moving anything that is worthy of prison time avoid food grade bags.  If you must use food grade bags do not bother with pulling a vacuum.  Instead spend $100-200 and purchase a good quality industrial grade sealer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peoples intuition says that odors flow with the air from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, therefor a vacuum would pull the odor inward.... in the macroscopic world this it true but not so for the microscopic world.  Diffusion currents are independent of absolute pressure.  The vacuum does nothing for you unless you have a pinhole, in fact a vacuum likely hurts in 2 ways: it hides pinholes from you if you leak test it and it causes stresses in your polymers.  Stressing a polymer will cause disordering of the structure (lowers crystallinity) and generates microscopic voids and cracks and increases diffusion rates.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mylar bags have the advantage of a vapor deposited metal layer that is highly ordered with a near 0 diffusion coefficient for just about everything.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MBBs are thicker and often times have multiple polymer layers with different solubility characteristics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Neither Mylar nor MBBs have metal foil layers thick enough to be discerned as metal on dual-beam x-ray inspection systems.  So in an customs inspection scenario the only way anyone would know is if they opened the package to look.  In that case I cannot say what looks more suspicious a MBB or Clear Bagging.  If I were faced with that scenario I think I'd go with a MBB and just make sure to disguise the package as something that is normally shipped in a MBB or mylar bag... in any case a good quality MBB WILL fool even the best dogs or molecular inspection systems whereas LDPE will certainly not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    anyways skip the vacuum and look at the TEW style impulse sealers.  They're a Taiwanese firm that makes reasonably good quality sealers for a good price.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, you'd think there'd be more chemists/chemEs around here that know this stuff given the whole "drug" theme of this forum.  I'm surprised that I'm the one clearing up this misconception and not one of them.  Most likely it's simply that those who know the most don't care to post it...  Those in the lead in shipping technology don't want to help anyone else catch up, there's no financial incentive, in fact there's something of a dis-incentive.
    <br/>

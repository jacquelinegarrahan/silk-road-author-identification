    I'm flying into a big city (several big cities actually) and I'm not sure if I should be doing this. I normally carry prescriptions on me and figured I'd just gel cap the stuff and mix it along with everything else. Oh yeah, I'm "that guy" who gets pulled over every other flight to get hand swabs and sniffed by dogs for explosives and gunpowder, to make things worse. I think I should be ok but don't want to take any risks. Tips would be much appreciated.

    Just play it cool, I've stumbled through security on several international flights when I was younger with weed, mushrooms, and once a few tabs of E without even realizing until part or all the way through. I think acting very strongly as if you have nothing to hide will get you through fine, and check it if you can. Checked in your shaving kit, mixed in a pill bottle with shit that looks like it and you should be fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not expert but that's what I'd do.

    but if you want stealth on top of that, get a protein powder canister and stick it in there as though it's protein shake mix.  I could be wrong, but they shouldn't fuq wit it.
    <br/>
    Even after opening and smelling it, you would still be okay, b/c that shit is supposed to look and taste a little stale. If the mix was strong smelling and you dumped it and replaced it right before your trip, it wouldn't even smell like shrooms.

    Believe it or not, I'm really big into working out and my protein supplements have been rifled through 4/5 times. I don't think I'm on any kind of watchlist. In fact, I get to skip the lines at most major airports before getting to the scanners. I dunno, maybe I just give off bad vibes =\.

    Gel cap them and put them in a vitamin bottle. They will not look at it twice and the dogs can not smell it.

    <br/>
    For more entertainment, take a small amount of potassium nitrate and sprinkle it on peoples carry on luggage when they walk by and as you do stuff like take your shoes off, fumble with your carry on, laptop, etc. Makes the bomb dogs go nuts and after the third or forth person they put the dogs up.

    jsames link although that maybe fun.. drug dogs and bomb dogs are different they are trained for either or not both. you may get them to put the bomb dogs up but then you still got drug dogs.
    <br/>
    to answer the OP question they have the spectrum scanners or wheever they are called that can see every inch of your skin when you go through it. scary huh?  i would get stanback powder wrapper and put it in there either 5 different wraps or so and put it in your luggage not carry on. put it with other medicines or toiletries to make it more convincing.
    <br/>
    i had 2cb in my sock when i went to the spectrum scanners ( dumb huh?) i forgot it was in there but only remembered when i was next in line..
    <br/>
    so i thought "fuck it" went through .. no hitches.. was only about 50 mg though..  but those scanners should have seen that baggie i guess the airport i was at didnt scan below the ankles maybe? im not sure..  are you flying international? or within usa?

    I have as well, and mushrooms are not one of the 9 drugs that the dogs are trained to sniff out. From experience and to my knowledge no one has ever gotten a dog to sniff out psilocybin mushrooms. I know a lot of southern boys that have tried to train their dogs to find them and none have ever succeeded.

     I have as well, and mushrooms are not one of the 9 drugs that the dogs are trained to sniff out. From experience and to my knowledge no one has ever gotten a dog to sniff out psilocybin mushrooms. I know a lot of southern boys that have tried to train their dogs to find them and none have ever succeeded.

    Dogs can definitely be trained to smell mushrooms though.  I have never heard of law enforcement doing it though.

    Psilocybin Mushrooms, I am willing to say no on. I have tried, I know of professional trainers that have tried, They do not seem to be able to smell the psilocybin and that is the key.

    I don't know if there is something distinguishable in psilocybin mushrooms that they could train them on.  When they train dogs to smell drugs, it's not the drug itself that it is trained to smell.  You can buy the kits that they use, it's a certain ingredient that is in the drug that they train them to detect.  We were discussing this on another board and discussing the exact ingredients in each drug that they are trained to smell.  I can't remember any of them off the top of my head but I could go probably go find the discussion.  I personally find this stuff very interesting.

    I'm going to empty fill up a few capsules of mdma and just drop them into a full bottle of vitamins so they blend in. They will be slightly different colored so I'll know which is which, but I really don't see them going through checked luggage just over some vitamins. I would maybe put the mushrooms in some empty cinnamon capsules and check your luggage.

    I've flown with entire bottle of Everclear by checking them, and that shit is basically gas haha.

    I hallucinate very easily (like on 20mg). I can make a 500mg baggie last 4 months. Not a good idea.

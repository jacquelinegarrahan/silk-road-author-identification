    G'dday.

    Been scoping out a few different vendors. A couple who have stuff I'd like a lot, are from the Netherlands. It's a pain in the ass considering they raise a red flag for just about anywhere. I mean a tiny envelope less of a red flag perhaps but a red flag all the same. I'd hoped that anyone who''d ordered from the NL could just post saying their success rates. I.e they're 2 for 2 or 0/3 or something.

    I've had several successful deliveries from the Netherlands, but I stopped ordering from that country just to be on the safe side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything came in small and discreet envelopes, nothing over 1g.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only country I'm ordering from is the UK (reich and limetless!), everything else I try to be local.
    <br/>

    BTW, I'm in north america.

    I have had 7/7 from NL. I haven't ordered anything in bulk though, so i'm sure that is a factor in the success rate for my orders!

    I've ordered a few packages from the Netherlands. I'm in the midwest of the USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Three orders in total from Schizofreen. The first package did not come, the second package arrived, and the third package did not come. 33% success rate. 1/3.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've placed two orders with DutchQualityBeans. The first package arrived, this was a small order. The second package did not. 50% success. 1/2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My latest order is with SuperTrips. This is my largest order yet, and according to the tracking info he provided it has made it through customs and is currently at my local post office to be delivered. I assume this will be making it's way to me. So 100%, 1/1.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Overall, I'm very hesitant to order anything from the Netherlands. They're very strict and good at catching items. Schizofreen has great feedback and gives buyers good experiences. I just assume that it was a luck of the draw thing with those two packages with him, and he more than made up for it later. I won't order from him again though just because of possible shipping issues, but his product(s) are amazing. But he's a nice guy. Always gave him a 5/5.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    DQB has been having problems lately. Lots of packages going missing in the last few weeks. Not saying anything is up, but it seems weird that most of his packages to the U.S. aren't arriving, while all other countries in Europe are reporting successes. Check out his profile page/feedback to get the latest information on him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SuperTrips has great feedback, has some great review threads here on the forums, and most everyone receives his items. He also has a 100% refund policy if you don't receive your order. Little slow at the beginning with marking in transit and supplying you the promised tracking information, but order looks like it will arrive in 12 days. One of the fastest shipping times from overseas I've ever had.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are my experiences. I plan to order from other NL vendors just to get a feel for who's best to order from in the future. NL have the best MDMA around.

    I am in no doubt packages from NL get scrutinised more, but I dont think customs are as good as people like to make out. Its easier to say the package was intercepted rather than "Oh shit, I forgot to send it last week."

    1/1 for me.
    <br/>
    I order 1g of coke (a sample too see if i should order more/larger) from SuperTrips.
    <br/>
    I didnt like signing for it, but understood why when i ordered (so he can refund/reship without scamm).
    <br/>
    Package was very large for just a gram,  packaging in general could have been better, but was decent enough, but and arrived no worries.
    <br/>
    The coke however was low quality and tasted and smelled like fucking dogs piss, it was fucking disguisting, and no numbing so the tast lingered.
    <br/>
    Def wasnt worth all that worry for some shit so nasty that i even felt bad giving away for free to frineds.
    <br/>
    Funny that i have never seen anyone else mention this about his coke, some even give it good reviews.

    I've ordered 4 things from the NL and none arrived. 3 were at the exact time Drnyx had the TNT issue. He took great care of me though. Seems like when you send through a neighboring country things come through. Also one gram of hash from the NL never made it.

    1/3 to the east coast USA and ironically the 1 success was from a special deal I worked out with a NL vendor who does not normally ship to the USA.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The two failures were 10 Pink Stars from Skyy, against whom all corroborating evidence from other buyers suggests that he oversold what he didn't have in stock and these were never even sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More distressingly, the other failure was Beatles tabs from Albion that should have taken ~10 days but never arrived after 3 weeks. I was much more disheartened by this than the Skyy pills. Good LSD has been so fleetingly rare on SR this summer, and tabs are the most trivial things of all to ship. I have no sure explanation as to how these could have disappeared other than to blame the notoriously unreliable privatized Dutch post or that customs and/or the US postal service is stocked with thieves who will indiscriminately steal packages postmarked from the NL in the hope of finding pills, powders, or plants for their own use.

    <br/>
    The darker possibilities are that customs is much more sophisticated than we imagine or that my address has been flagged for NL outbound packages. Against the first is the fact that others I know in the same region received theirs, and against the second is the fact that the one success came *after* the Skyy fiasco.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Regardless whether due to thieving postal employees or hyper-vigilant customs scrutiny, the failure of those Albion tabs to make it have permanently soured me on ever ordering from the NL again.

    9/9, but one of them customs definitely found the drugs inside. They just pushed it through though. I suspect they were trying to start a little investigation, but I never reused the worker/location.

    But that 1 was also poorly packaged IMO because it was a parcel rather than an envelope. Small envelopes can safely hold up to 100gs of mdma, etc *IMHO*, so long as the vendor is using a hard shell surrounding the product that the ion spectos can't punch through. I always leave wait quite sometime after arrival before going to my box to retrieve though.

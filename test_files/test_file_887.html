    Indeed there was a lot of bitching and commotion, but in saying that I think there was some very useful information amongst the jargon. Personally it is a little aggravating to see some of that information disappear, not because I had contributed,  but because it was valuable to newer members. The only thing we are going to see now is more Aussie threads repeating the same old questions.

    It was deleted with good reason, too many indiscreet posts disclosing too much drawing unnecessary attention, off topic rants, chronic hypocrisy, I could go on all day but lets just say it is gone and that's that.

    Best leave it to the vendor feedback. If you order from someone and it doesnt arrive, just put in the feedback the country and that it didnt arrive so that others (who are checking the vendor already anyway) can see who is sending orders or not.

    Is there a thread somewhere to discuss today'd bust? What are peoples thoughts?  It seems alot of legal international mail has been pretty slow of late which suggest that the x-ray processing of all imbound mail for a short period resulted in 10day plus delays to all mail which i wouldnt consider sustainable. SSBD fell free to delete if you dont think this post furthers the cause...

    Quit with the conspiracy theories mate, I can re post the PM I received from the OP michelBluth if you like explaining as to why he deleted it but basically my previous post kind of sums it up. That thread had become an embarrassment, a lot of people need to grow up and get over themselves if we want to run an aussie specific thread.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If people want one I am prepared to start another with one condition, any fucktards posting indiscreet, irrelevant and/or off topic rants will see their posts deleted. What we will have is a functional domestic and o/s thread we can use to warn of vendors scamming aussies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So no meth rants
    <br/>
    No naming of vendors who are getting their shit into AU
    <br/>
    No political/sociological rants
    <br/>
    No aussie bashing

    ohhh nooo they confiscated 2000 LSD tabs, what a shame!! Too Bad they didnt catch the 100,000+ that most likely made it in. Whats funny is that the public actually believes that they cracked down and they have it all under control. I say if it makes them happy to put on a show then let them do it.

    Does an inner opaque plastic layer make a package safer? This is assuming the cannabis is well sealed otherwise (smell proof) and the outer box is of solid condition.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had a couple buyers request some type of inner opaque packaging so that if the box was opened the cannabis itself would be hidden within an opaque layer. I have not personally heard of any problems without having an opaque layer, or had any myself. I was under the impression that if USPS had a warrant to open your package they are probably going to rip right through that opaque layer. As would your girlfriend, parents, neighbor, dog, etc. Is there something I am not aware of? What are the pros and cons of using another layer of opaque plastic?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I look forward to your comments. Security is of the utmost importance to me and I want to make sure that the best practices are put into use. I currently use plastic vacuum bags but am planning the switch to mylar with all the shipping I am now doing. That will make this a moot point but I am still interested in learning the why.

    I think the concern of having the outer box punctured is real. Mishandling of USPS boxes is typical from my point of view, and if someone manages to put a finger-sized hole in the box ("somehow") a opaque layer between the buds and the box would be a security measure that would not be beneficial. I have seen some vendors have smell-proof baggies that have one side that is completely opaque (black). Mylar food bags are the best for nugs imo because they don't actually compress the nugs themselves, but that is just my opinion based on experience of buying from various vendors. But, even two pieces of cardboard do the trick, as long as no one can open it up/puncture it and obviously know its nugs.

    IMO mylar bags or something non-transparent would be ideal. I do a lot of shipping at work and on several occasions I have had packages ripped open due to USPS mishandling. They are usually delivered with all contents inside a large plastic bag with a letter explaining what happened. I would never ship ganja without an opaque inner layer.

    as long as smell free should be sweet
    <br/>
    boxes get pressed down sometimes (unless fragile)
    <br/>
    best feel box with random crap(newspaper, bobble tape, cardboard) so ur package stays kinder surprise but i cant hear toys shaking inside and it doesnt smell

    Being new here, I haven't seen a very wide variety of packaging, but I've had two of them that I believe are almost impossible to find out :P Key word: almost. One was in this silver shiny type bag, vacuum sealed, and then the buds vacuum sealed inside with packing peanuts to keep the buds safe(my guess). The second was the bud wrapped up in a ton of newspaper, after double vacuum seal of course. I've also had one that came into a DVD case, but doing that caused the buds to become compressed.

    The reason people want a visual barrier is because if the package would accidentally get busted/ripped open then when they take the item out to put it into a new package or to try to fix the package it would be pretty obvious what it is and well there goes your buyers product and possibly their freedom.
    <br/>
    On to the warrant statement, of course if they have a warrant they are going to rip it open. That's the whole point of a warrant...
    <br/>
    I personally would not buy bud from a seller that won't put some type of visual barrier (some type of paper or cardboard etc..) either inside the vac seal or wrapped and taped around the vac sealed product.
    <br/>
    Why? Because if it would get busted open and the postal worker doesn't know what it is because they can't see it, then they just package it back up and ship it on then you possibly saved my freedom and you will still have 1 more customer instead of 1 less one.
    <br/>
    So it's a win win for both of us.

    This is some great info - hopefully more will chime in. All my packages henceforth are going to have an opaque barrier. Additionally I have decided to switch to mylar bags which seem to have the best all around qualities for what I am shipping. Be safe!

    Good, keep up the great work and you'll be making bank with those dank looking nugs that you got  8)
    <br/>
    I'll bookmark your vendor page, I might be making a purchase in the future because you seam like a vendor that is going to be taking this very seriously.

    Any extra layer of security is always welcomed, I've had packages opened by customs and still get through unharmed :)
    <br/>
    Mylar is excellent for a visual barrier, and a nice label of some innocuous product adds another level, appropriate accompanying paperwork yet another bit etc
    <br/>
    Just remember to label it as something boring or a postman could still nick it instead of repacking it and sending it on.

    I got an item when expected (3-5 days from being marked in transit)
    <br/>
    How likely is it that it was intercepted?
    <br/>
    I didn't have to sign for it, it was left in the mailbox along with my normal mail
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: It's been about 30 hours since I took the package, would they wait this long?

    What leads you to believe that the package was intercepted? If they intercepted the package, they wouldn't place it back into transit. They would either seize it and send you a seizure letter, or conduct a controlled delivery if it was a large amount of an illicit substance. I honestly don't understand what you're worried about. Is this serious?

    I would say the chances of your package having been intercepted fall around the 0% mark, considering you have it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for waiting 30 hours, probably not.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thumbs up for the caution...  :o

    Yes we do which is why you got a bit slating, its not that we don't care because as a community we do try to help each other but your o/p basically said you ordered from SR, your order arrived in normal time and there were no issues and what should you do?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If however the packaging was not great bring it to the forums and PM the vendor and see what they have to say because that will help others and encourage better practices by the vendor.

    I completely understand. The first time I ordered international it came quickly, but I had to sign for it AT the PO (in the middle of nowhere, and the employee had me sign). I was so afraid the police were going to arrive at my house I let the package sit in the car for an hour then I opened it outside and tried to burn the evidence (not the contents), but it was windy and freaking USPS Express envelopes are a bitch to burn, I even dumped lighter fluid on it. No luck with that, I finally calmed down that night and was able to enjoy my item. Everytime I order something I feel like it won't arrive.
    <br/>
    We all have our moments.
    <br/>
    Silk Road is too good to be true, but that's what makes it great.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think all controlled deliveries they have you sign for the package though, right? And there are police nearby watching.From what I've read in articles, they try to rush in quickly but not too quickly so they can catch you red handed after you open it, but not have enough time to get rid of it or leave..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck with your future purchases and may you never have a controlled delivery : )

    I honestly can't tell if this is serious, or very dry sarcasm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A): Signed for a package.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    B) At a P.O. "in the middle of nowhere'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    C) Opened in right away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To those new to these parts, these are all things that you should never, ever do.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, I'm leaning towards dry sarcasm here, but if you can please confirm:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Pants-on-head retarded"?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or just sarcasm?

    We do indeed. I'm tossing and turning every night thinking about an order that should be waiting for me when I get home in a few days. I don't know if I'm just excited (although I am *very* excited about this particular order, it's my DoC and haven't had it in 18 months) or if not being home is giving me a sense of not being in control and therefore giving me the jitters. I think it's a little of column A, a little of column B :)

     I honestly can't tell if this is serious, or very dry sarcasm.

     You:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A): Signed for a package.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     B) At a P.O. "in the middle of nowhere'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     C) Opened in right away.

     To those new to these parts, these are all things that you should never, ever do.

     <br/>
     So, I'm leaning towards dry sarcasm here, but if you can please confirm:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Pants-on-head retarded"?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Or just sarcasm?

    Wow, it's like you know me. I am so sarcastic all the time I can't even tell when I'm joking anymore. Just trying to make the OP feel better, is that so wrong?
    <br/>
    Also I do have some mental issues so thanks for pointing that out, I tend to ignore them.
    <br/>

    I did sign for an order one time though though, the ONLY one I signed for, it WAS international and I did not think it through obviously (and I was desperate and new to SR). I see all kinds of people ordering international overseas signing for things. It's crazy how much they trust the postal system more than the seller, especially if it's being delivered straight to their door.

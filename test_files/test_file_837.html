    I've ordered 6g of shrooms form the netherlands to the UK. Is it likely to reach by Tuesday? If not I seriously need to cancel.
    <br/>
    I also ordered to my home address. Is this a bad thing? What will be the effects if the package gets intercepted? Is it likely to get caught with that weight/drug type? I've never ordered anything from abroad before, or anything illegal before - will it look suspicious if I get a package from the Netherlands?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Am I being too paranoid? I seriously don't want to get caught/for the package to be late.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Help!

    NL orders usually take anywhere from 2-4weeks to the US. Sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, but that is the rule of thumb.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Other than that, plenty of magic truffle orders have been seized from NL-&gt;US(from clearnet vendors, at that) and the ones I have known only received a notice of seizure in the mail. I wouldn't be worried, smoke a joint and calm down.

    Cancel your order. It is always better to protect your safety with the sure thing rather than risking ANYTHING for something that isn't guaranteed. Especially if you're ordering from the Netherlands.

    Woops, totally missed the UK part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The notice of seizure should be the exact same in the UK as in the US. Just a letter, and nothing more.
    <br/>
    Shipping times however, 2 days to a week. Sometimes longer, so yes there is a chance it will not make it by next Tuesday.

    He has no obligation to refund your money, you just have to hope that he hasn't actually sent your order. How long ago was this?  Even if he doesn't refund you, if your security is THAT important to you then you'll have to just take the hit and move on.

    Why are you so worried about it arriving after Tuesday?

    Six grams of shrooms? No LEO is going to waste their time on six measly grams in my opinion, maybe six grams of heroin but definitely not shrooms. I wouldn't worry about it, but my advice is never admit it's being sent to your home address nonetheless. ;)

    It was today the order went through, and he hasn't sent it yet... I'm in two minds as to what to do.

    As for the Tuesday part, I live with my parents, and that's when they're back... I know, sounds super wussy, but that's the way it is.

    I've already asked him to cancel... guess I'll have to see what he says.

    I know how you feel--I've been in that horrible, paranoid mindset before and it sucks.  But the fact is--you hardly have to worry about LEOs catching up with you regarding this one order.  As has been said, if they even catch it, you'll just get a letter saying "don't do that again".  They wouldn't try to bust you unless it was possible that you were ordering with intent to distribute, and even then, there's more to it than just that.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As for your parents...do they open your mail, really?  If so, can you "intercept" the mail from them?  Like grab it out of the box before they do?  I've done this waaay back in the day when I was living at home.  it might be a little shady, but you can play it cool.  If not, does your post office have a service for holding your mail, or forwarding your mail?  Perhaps you could get yourself a 24-hour mailbox address, and then have your post office forward any letters addressed to you to your new mailbox?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But yeah, don't order from the NL again.  It's a risk that can usually be avoided on here.

    I like the harm reduction, deadra7, but I really don't think you should be profiling other users on this anonymous forum--no matter how obvious it might be.  It's unnecessary, and you really don't know who this guy/girl is, let alone how old s/he is or what his/her living situation is.  If s/he actually is a kid, s/he probably doesn't appreciate being identified as such.

    All good, DeadRa7--I didn't mean anything by it really, I just thought of a similar situation I was in where I had shady, illegal packages shipped to my family's house at the beach, and I had to intercept the mail so the "elders" wouldn't see the goods.  So I didn't even think he might be a kid until your post.

    And yeah, I totally agree you really gotta do your homework in order to use this site effectively.  I spent like a good month perusing the forums and reading the wikis and guides, so when I placed my first order, I was pretty sure no harm would come from it.  And it didn't.  Yet here I am, over a year later, and I've definitely learned a few things along the way through experience that I hadn't considered back when I was naive.  The fact is, some people just get high from being here, and don't stop to think of their role on Silk Road.  It's one thing to simply place successful orders, but it's another to be a pleasure to do business with, and to become a helpful, constructive member of the community.

     I know how you feel--I've been in that horrible, paranoid mindset before and it sucks.  But the fact is--you hardly have to worry about LEOs catching up with you regarding this one order.  As has been said, if they even catch it, you'll just get a letter saying "don't do that again".  They wouldn't try to bust you unless it was possible that you were ordering with intent to distribute, and even then, there's more to it than just that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As for your parents...do they open your mail, really?  If so, can you "intercept" the mail from them?  Like grab it out of the box before they do?  I've done this waaay back in the day when I was living at home.  it might be a little shady, but you can play it cool.  If not, does your post office have a service for holding your mail, or forwarding your mail?  Perhaps you could get yourself a 24-hour mailbox address, and then have your post office forward any letters addressed to you to your new mailbox?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But yeah, don't order from the NL again.  It's a risk that can usually be avoided on here.

     I like the harm reduction, deadra7, but I really don't think you should be profiling other users on this anonymous forum--no matter how obvious it might be.  It's unnecessary, and you really don't know who this guy/girl is, let alone how old s/he is or what his/her living situation is.  If s/he actually is a kid, s/he probably doesn't appreciate being identified as such.

    Totally. I've never touched 4chan in my life, so you can lay off the shitty ill-founded stereotypes. I've done my research, thought this through a lot, and know full well what I'm doing - I just grew increasingly concerned as I read stories from this very forum about jail time and fines etc.

    If it gets here before Wednesday, that's fine - NL to UK - is 6 days realistic?

    You're fine, i don't think you've got anything to really worry about. I've had bigger things in shit packaging still got here in one piece. There's too much mail for them to do anything and 6 grams isn't even big enough to be a decent bust, you bad man, you. Who did you order it off? Maybe other vendors on here can vouch for him to cam your young nerves &lt;3 Shrooms never smelt bad through the post and i never got them vacuum sealed, air mailer did a good enough job.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wouldn't expect it for Tuesday tho unless it was shipped around Thursday if you're lucky :&lt; Wanker postman. Especially for your very first order, and a small amount, you're not gonna go bowlegged walking back to your cellie. I would suggest using your real first inital, and real last name. That way you have just a little bit more wiggle room if anything ever went tits up. I think anyway  ::)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nice post Wazup7 too, +1
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit, i'd also say i think 6 working days is reasonable and i'd expect delivery around then but Dutch post is just as slow and clumbsy as royal mail so you always have to think of their lazy, unreliable asses.

    Bless, I remember my first buy too : D

    What you're going through is completely natural, I doubt anyone on here, Vendor or Buyer, for that matter didn't feel a little bit of what you're going through. I know I was shitting bricks waiting for my first order to come from abroad. I would:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. Chill, reassure yourself with all the many many successful transactions evident in the reviews
    <br/>
    2. Remember that your order just isn't that special (6 measly grammes)
    <br/>
    3. If you haven't been arsed to use Liberte, remove Tor/PGP etc and use Eraser to write over the free space on your hard drive. (Now is probably a good time to sort out your anonymity).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think you're going to be fine buddy.

    Jeez.  If you're buying drugs you're taking a chance - if you're that paranoid, why buy drugs in the first place?  Think about what is the worst that can happen -  I got arrested in the UK with a bunch of MDMA and got a fine (which I didn't pay) and a criminal record which has never affected me.  The judge was more bored than I was scared.  The world does not think your drugs are that important.

    To the OP:  If you listen really closely, you can likely hear the dull thumping of multiple DEA choppers inbound.  This is it, this is the break they have been waiting for.  There will be dogs on ziplines crashing through your skylight at any moment.

    You need to just relax. Just because something is coming from the netherlands and it's illegal doesn't mean every postal worker is going to look at it and think 'is this drugs?'.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing you're doing is causing a head ache for the poor vendor that has to deal with you. If the option to finalize is there, it's in transit. Just wait and stop worrying.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if it is found the only thing you will receive is a letter saying something was found and if you want to claim follow these instructions...

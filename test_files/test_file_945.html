    I have had over 10 successful orders to my address so far and have not been worried about them not showing up. But as with every order, I like to err on the side of caution. I am about to place multiple orders at once and was wondering if anyone had any reason not to do this.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am being overly paranoid, right? Shouldn't make a difference as all the packages are from different vendors and won't look the same.

    The risk factor doesn't seem any higher, except for if one gets intercepted, you might lose them all, and get nailed on all of them at once (harder to claim that 3 different people randomly mailed you drugs at once)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had successful mulch-deliveries, sometimes simultaneous, but only in situations / to addresses that it wouldn't seem conspicuous.

    If all your vendors ship domestically I don't see any problem with receiving multiple packages. If they are international shipments then I would split that to two groups: 1 being if they ship with business return addresses, 2 being if they ship with personal addresses. Receiving lots of international mail from businesses might seem a little odd but it's still a business so whatever; but lots of international mail from personal addresses might raise an eyebrow or two. Personally, I like to limit my packs to 3-4 spread out across 1 month

    I wouldn't worry about it.

    I think it would only get sus if you used different names for the package.

    I've had multiple packages arrive the same day with no trouble.

    Firstly when you say "orders to my address" I sincerely hope you mean your anonymous drop address that is in no way linked to you someone you know?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If it is to your home or friends address then placing multiple orders to the same address is a bad fucking idea IMHO. It concerns me when I read posts like this only to see others posting replies like "yeah it'll be fine mate go for it". When it comes to individuals liberty I would invite others to seriously consider the advice they dish out freely on this forum like we are doing nothing illegal here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also if those orders you speak of are coming o/s you can add trafficking to your potential list of charges, I don't know what country you live in but where I come from LE do not just brush that shit off, then send your ass to jail. You may be able to talk your way out of one order but you try using plausible deniability as a defense if you have 5.

    In my case im waiting too. Like 3 packages in this week. Do you say that shipping to the real address with my real name is bad?

    What do you advise? A house random with random name? Less packages and more quantity? Know address wih random name?

    A lot depends on which country you are in, some countries like the US link names to addresses so if you use a fake name or the name of a previous occupant the mail service may not deliver the mail or they may redirect it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have had a lot of people PM me after I posted in this thread asking for advise, I should make it clear I am no authority on setting up safe drop addresses in countries all over the world, I only really know some options for my own country.

    How does the US link names to addresses, is this link checked when the address is scanned by computer? On what register is that name/address based, in the Netherlands each city keeps a registration of it's residents and everybody has a registered address, but i thought this was not the case in the US.

    I'm quite sure in many cases, the government does not link people to addresses.  Let's say, for example, the case of a large shared house. Let's say 20 people in it. Every semester at University, the occupancy of this house changes. Sometimes people living there do not even sign leases. There is no way that anyone outside of the people around that shared house would know who is there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even then, in a not-shared house by university, the residents could also change on a semester basis. Somebody subletting a room, is signing a contract with the person on the lease. That person would not be known to be living there except by the people in that house (or I guess people he knows.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The gov't does link you to your permanent address though. The one that is on your drivers license. Or the one you use to file for gov't support. That would be noted. But, if you move and don't update your license (or tell the post office to forward old mail etc) you could sort of stay off the grid. At least in my evaluation of this.

    I live in the U.S. currently and names are linked to addresses.  In fact you are linked to every address you have ever resided at.  This information is primarily used for identification and for credit purposes.  The theory is that the longer you are at an address the more stable and reliable a person you are, at least when it comes to credit.  This is what they claim this information is primarily used for.  This is how "finder" sites can locate individuals by simply entering a name!

    Again, like I said before. I don't think this is always true. It is in the case of a permanent address. But using the example of a college student at University, they would have a different, temporary address, from their registered permanent one (most likely their parents home).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you put in their name on a finder site, the address that will come up is most likely the permanent one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are certainly cases where an address can be unlinked to a name. Though, it would probably seem that most of the time the name is linked.

    so how dangerous is it to have o/s stuff mailed to your house/po box?  ive been at it a while, received 25 or 30 orders, only 6 or 7 of them domestic, i currently have 2 o/s no-shows, no letter, and a decent sized pack is 1 day late.  You think I should be worried?

    Really depends on what kind of purchase the 2 no shows were.  I mean I'd still chill out from ordering over seas to that P.O. box if they were very recent.

    Also are you sure the sellers just didn't send it?  Always could be a possibility.

    I too have ordered multiple packages to the same drop more than once.  The key is obviously not to do it every week of the month and to do it with sellers you know have good packaging.  Still it makes sense that it is a bigger risk involved but the game we play in is a gamble it self, just be smart and be prepared when shit hits the fan.

    I don't think SSBD was saying that you couldn't "get away with it." Obviously, from this thread, several people have successfully done parallel orders to the same address.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With that said, the risk goes up. That's not debatable. If one package gets intercepted, the rest of your incoming packages would be suspect. With only a single package, you have more plausible deniability than if you have, let's say, three.

    I am not sure but I would take an educated guess that it all depends on how you register that address, so your example makes sense.  If you simply redirect your mail to a college then I do not believe it will be linked, at least not permanently.  This is a good thing to look into and I will be sure too.  Anyone reading should do the same, guessing at it serves no purpose.

    I mostly referring to ordering from o/s, personally I would never use my home address or an address easily linked to me for international orders due to the risk of customs seizing it and LE kicking my door down. I don't know what its like in your country but where I am the chances of a domestic intercept are virtually non existent, I still wouldn't feel all that comfortable with multiple orders in transit though but that's just me.

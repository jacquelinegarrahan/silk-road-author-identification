    Two kids 20 years old and now fucked for life...god this war is relentless. About 700 doses of love down the drain too :(
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looks like 100g's of Molly come across, they are going to roll on your ass and not just confiscate it and send a letter. Keep your house clean! Hope the shippers are changing methods often...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Nineteen-year-old Tulane University students Jules Staib and Wyatt Silverman allegedly accepted a package containing the drug commonly known as "Molly" at the off-campus Kappa Sigma fraternity house in Uptown early Friday afternoon. The only problem is that the courier was an undercover law enforcement agent, according to authorities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A subsequent search of Staib's and Silverman's bedrooms unveiled weed, psychedelic mushrooms, LSD, the psychedelic drug DMT, opium, powdered cocaine and narcotics paraphernalia, a State Police trooper wrote in an affidavit filed in New Orleans criminal court. Staib and Silverman were jailed and accused of a variety of state drug offenses, including possession with intent to distribute "Molly" MDMA, a more pure form of ecstasy.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Asked to comment on the case, Tulane spokesman Mike Strecker on Tuesday wrote in a statement that any students suspected of non-academic misconduct must undergo a disciplinary hearing process. Meanwhile, a knock at Kappa Sigma's door went unanswered.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    State Police say they were working alongside the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection as well as the U.S. Postal Service and learned of a package containing 107 grams of MDMA sent to the Kappa Sigma house in the 600 block of Broadway Street. In an affidavit, a state trooper reported that an undercover agent conducted a controlled delivery of MDMA to the house about 12:45 p.m. Friday. After Staib and Silverman accepted it, agents searched their bedrooms, court papers say.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Allegedly, in Staib's bedroom there were 21.6 grams of marijuana, 68.7 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, 46 doses of LSD, .91 grams of DMT, 47.6 grams of opium and paraphernalia. Court papers allege that the MDMA was located in Silverman's room, where there were also .75 grams of powdered cocaine, 11 doses of LSD, .25 grams of marijuana and paraphernalia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Aside from possession with intent to distribute MDMA, Staib and Silverman were each booked with possession of LSD, possession of marijuana and unlawful use or possession of drug paraphernalia.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Staib, of Baton Rouge, was also booked with possession of psilocybin mushrooms, possession of opiates and possession of DMT, records show. Silverman, of Pittsburgh, was also booked with possession of cocaine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Magistrate Commissioner Juana Lombard on Saturday released Staib on his own recognizance in lieu of $33,500 bail. Magistrate Commissioner Harry Cantrell set a $23,000 bail for Silverman.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Staib's attorney is Robert Jenkins. It does not appear that Silverman had retained anyone as of Tuesday afternoon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Troopers who participated in the arrests of Silverman Staib are assigned to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Task Force, State Police said. The task force is part of a program that enhances and coordinates drug control efforts among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, State Police explained.
    <br/>

    Nice stash they had.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I guess even if it breaks your heart never sign for anything at the door.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What happens if it's in your real name and you refuse? Assuming your house is clean if they come in anyway with warrant.

    How do they "both" accept the package when only one signature is required?  They seem to be SR users from the variety of stock they had, especially the DMT. 107g is quite a bit and i'm willing to bet word spread around campus about their operation, (c'mon, try to stop people talking about some shit like that at a college campus of all places) as opposed to a customs discovery.
    <br/>

    As previously stated here numerous times; don't sign, don't sign, don't sign... deny, deny, deny.

    this is exactly why I do not sell at my school
    <br/>
    Fuck i feel so bad for these guys, I use to live right by Tulane.
    <br/>
    Thats a party school their my friend. It might be a private University but those kids seriously know how to party.
    <br/>
    Less than 15 minutes away is this club called Amps and that bitch is always wild. Tons of lights dubstep and techno. I knew a guy selling 6apb as Molly for 20 a capsule I saw him with 2 grand in his wallet after one night.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can bet a million dollars I know exactly what they were stocking up for too. Buku Fest is coming up and they have a great line up. These guys were going to move that 100 grams of molly in one fucking weekend. If I still lived in New Orleans this could have been my fate. I would be hustling hard.

    also, we don't know the events surrounding this bust as far as how careful these two were.  you can never be too careful though, so it does serve as a good reminder of the importance of protecting yourself, your information, and your dealings here.

    Well when I got my 1 gram from underground syndicate and I opened the package I said damn this is dank. I am saying this to say it must be impossible to to hide the smell of 100 grams of molly of any quality. Dogs must be able to smell a quantity that large.
    <br/>
    Correct me if I am wrong but vacuum sealing bags is not smell proof but rather smell resistant. Eventually the smell will come out.
    <br/>
    I read a thread here about dogs sniffing out molly.
    <br/>
    But everyone is right they should have not signed for the package.
    <br/>

    This article really hits home, because I have friends that go to Tulane and I lived in the area a majority of my life.

    Impressive collection. Pretty absent-minded to sign for an overseas 100g package in a house with bud, shrooms, LSD, opiates, rip and DMT. Definitely was a silk road bust  :(

    It seems to me that these guys just discovered the Silk Road, had lots of access to money (frat guys tend to be richer to begin with, and I'm sure nearly everyone in the house was chipping in), couldn't control themselves, and ordered a fuckbunch of packages to one address. And a frathouse, no less. Seriously, they had to have known hundreds of people who had houses near Tulane.

    SWIM believes that the students became too comfortable at the game. Never underestimate the game and play it as hard as you played it in the beginning. Stash houses, clean drop addresses, clean computers, clean internet (don't use your own wifi on the road), fake identities in real life, and most of all, when the game is over for you, deny deny deny!

    Are you seriously using SWIM on an anonymous drug forum, iheartmolly? That shit isn't going to save you no matter what, and it certainly isn't necessary here.

    These guys are fucked: (Going by Florida's mandatory minimum drug trafficking laws, couldn't find one for Louisiana but I'm sure it's not THAT different.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "893.135 Trafficking; mandatory sentences; suspension or reduction of sentences; conspiracy to engage in trafficking.—
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Opium)
    <br/>
    Oxycodone, Hydrocodine, Morphine, Opium and Hydromorphone
    <br/>
    4 grams to 14 grams = 3 year minimum mandatory sentence.
    <br/>
    14 grams to 28 grams = 15 year minimum mandatory sentence.
    <br/>
    28 grams to 30 kilograms = 25 year minimum mandatory sentence.
    <br/>
    30+ kilograms = life sentence.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    10 grams or more but less than 200 grams, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 3 years, and the defendant shall be ordered to pay a fine of $50,000.
    <br/>
    200 grams or more, but less than 400 grams, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 7 years,and the defendant shall be ordered to pay a fine of $100,000.
    <br/>
    400 grams or more, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 15 calendar years and pay a fine of $250,000."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The one kid had 48+ grams of opium, so it appears he's looking at doing over half his age behind bars (correct me if I'm wrong here). Not good, my thoughts go out to all parties involved, regardless of who or what is responsible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Never sign for a package and never accept it if under duress.
    <br/>
    2) Only ship to "clean", drug-free addresses, ESPECIALLY if you're ordering in large quantities.
    <br/>
    3) Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Be aware of your local drug trafficking laws and ask yourself, "is it really worth risking it"?

    This truly is a shame. I'm not going to generalize about frats and privilege, talk about what they should have known/not known, done/not done, but rather, bring up a question:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It seems that our system here is great on anonymity/encryption, great on the transaction/escrow, but the weakest leg is the shipment. I am going to use this "teaching moment" to read up on the best practices for receiving packages, but is there a better way we could be doing this?

    The biggest risk is definitely to the receiver of the package. However, it is up to the vendor to mitigate that risk with proper packaging and stealth, something which the seriousness of is not often enough stressed to vendors, nor are they held accountable enough imo by buyers when they get a sloppy, risky package. Buyers also need to be smart and realize that just because you can have five different parcels of drugs delivered to your door every week doesnt make it a good idea. However with all the temptation and unexpected pop-ups of deals it is hard not to over do it sometimes.

    There's nothing the police could do with login information. Its not like he knows who the vender is. They'll just know where in netherlands/germany/UK ??? they sent from along with other possible vender's return addresses and may gain access to a nice stash of bitcoins

     It seems that our system here is great on anonymity/encryption, great on the transaction/escrow, but the weakest leg is the shipment. I am going to use this "teaching moment" to read up on the best practices for receiving packages, but is there a better way we could be doing this?

    I'm pretty sure "Don't get felony quantities of schedule 1 drugs sent internationally to your frat house where you keep other quantities of schedule 1 drugs and then sign for the package" would qualify as a better way.

    Seconded. Never order bulk quantities, even if you intend to resell. Bulk is an ok deal if dealing face to face with the supplier, provided you are taking all safety measures. The existence of Silk Road should not let anyone think that drug business is becoming legal or safer. I'm really sad for these guys, a youth mistake, but they had it coming: ordering massive quantities, stockpiling in your own room, and selling in schools, where not all people are friends were too many mistakes.

    Why does someone have to sign for it? No one is forced to sign for the pack and no one should ever sign for a pack. I honestly dont see how a vendor who requires a signature even gets business here. Dont get me wrong, I dont blame the vendor one bit, he's protecting his investment. Its simple...you hear a knock, look out and see the postman (who obviously isnt you normal postman), you either A, ignore the door(assuming the person is smart enough to realize something isnt right with the delivery) or B, open the door refuse signing for the pack and watch your possible 100,000 walk away. Or C, open the door, sign for 100 grams of molly, get arrested and have your life fucked for what isnt worth it in the first place. This is coming from experience ITS HARD WATCHING YOUR MONEY WALK AWAY...but its not worth your freedom. The percentage of people who are arrested from drugs that are found in the mail are extremely low. This is just a story of young, opportunistic rookies.

    Use a method of tracked shipping that doesn't require a signature - for example royal mail airsure (UK) is tracked all the way into the destination country and they don't require a signature. Peace of mind for both parties without compromising safety.

    Vendors can't be throwing around bulk like this and having mediocre packaging.. yeah it's smell proof and double/triple vacuum sealed but if it's opened.. you're fucked. The vendor has really good smell proof stuff... just not hidden in any object like it should be
    <br/>
    <br/>
    MDMA needs to be trafficked in objects that when opened customs still passes it on. Take notes from the guys who have never lost packages.. there is one still here I know of and a couple that have come and gone.. no more vac sealed and wrapped in paper or plastic materials.

    Honestly, there's no good way of disguising the contents of a 100g pack.  You can make it so it's not IMMEDIATELY apparent when it's opened but if anyone's curious as to the contents and looks into it, they're gonna find the drugs.

    @backthatassup: I hope you weren't referring to me.  I was just playing the devil's advocate and making a point that perhaps the men in question had ordered from AH and therefore didn't have any choice but to sign/should have expected to.  I'm not taking sides, just asking questions and pointing things out as I see them.

       Never order bulk quantities, even if you intend to resell. Bulk is an ok deal if dealing face to face with the supplier, provided you are taking all safety measures. The existence of Silk Road should not let anyone think that drug business is becoming legal or safer. I'm really sad for these guys, a youth mistake, but they had it coming: ordering massive quantities, stockpiling in your own room, and selling in schools, where not all people are friends were too many mistakes.

    I think Chil has a valid point. Some people (I repeat; SOME people) may end up with a false sense of confidence and security from using Silk Road. People who've had little or no first hand experience of LE and who don't generally move within criminal social circles. They may start to think, "Well hey, I've had thirty odd orders come through no problem, even got a few international ones under my belt. This shit is foolproof!"
    <br/>
    If someone has the contacts to buy 100g of MDMA on the street, they'd more than likely be someone with a little more experience of criminal activities and therefore have a better understanding of the likely risk/reward outcome for such activities. At the very least they'd have a better idea of how to protect themselves and minimize such risks. This is all a sweeping generalization, but I believe it holds true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    TL;DR If you can't do the time, then don't do the crime!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do really feel for these guys though. A lot of doors have now slammed shut for them. I can tell you that this will constantly come back to haunt them at every turn through out their lives. It's crazy unfair how one mistake (admittedly a big one) that you make in your youth, will effect you for the rest of your life. :'(

    At this point, I think just sealing the product isn't enough; you're still fundamentally shipping the product. I'd suggest technical solutions, make the package look like something else.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example, a toy remote control car, one of those off-road ones with big knobby tires that you can pull off. Carefully foil/vac sealed, you could fit 100g of powder inside those tires, and have it be smell-proof. Custom's isn't going to rip apart every toy checking its nooks and crannies for drugs, and properly disguised, it could even be invisible to xray.

    Disguise edibles as a care package from mom, with a note and some boxers inside.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Figure out what is sent through the mail most, then evaluate it for potential disguises. 3/4 of a deodorant stick could be hash, with a usable amount of deodorant at the top.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My only problem would be that upon receiving them, I'd first use the deodorant and drive around the toy car to amuse myself knowing it's rolling around a couple thou. of drugs inside.

    a vendor would have to have a ton of toy cars/deodorant sticks/whatever to do this.. driving up product costs and not to mention how LONG it would take a vendor to do this.. if you were just saying for the large orders then i could see it. but even still it would slow down processing times for all orders big time..

    <br/>
    some weed vendors can't even keep up with orders as it is now.. throw in something like that and it would take them a week to ship an order..

    too bad for those dudes. sounds like they were pretty careless and i can guarantee they told anybody who would listen that they get drugs in the mail. what i found odd is that they were just charged with intent to distribute and possession and such.. nothing related to getting the molly through the mail in the first place.

    For domestic MDMA (at least here in the UK) a MBB + padding to make it appear as a business letter is pretty guaranteed to work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    International orders (particularly in 100g or so quantities) there should be no limit on the stealth really. Best stealth I've ever seen was a laptop with 300g of MDMA inside in MBBs - made it through customs flawlessly.

    You're right. For 50 and 100 g listings I used to get some stealth inside of small objects. Fake packaging and labeling on the outside along with inside the objects, the drugs were double/triple vac sealed, but not Xray proof. It came in an envelope, not a box. I assumed it would pass with all other small mail.. it was pretty small.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is always a risk with any kind of packaging.
    <br/>
    I decided that it's not worth having to sign for anymore. I'd rather send it to a drop and if a signature was required.. I'd forget about risking a mandatory minimum sentence in the US or being put in jail and then deported with nothing.
    <br/>

    My concept was to make it uniform in density, such that you can't "see" it on an xray - so it doesn't look like baggies, just another uniform volume of space.

    Just wanted to chime in on the signature topic. I always waive the signature when shipping express, but seen  packages had been signed more than a couple of times when checking tracking. Here's where it becomes tricky. What if these customers didn't sign? Fuck knows whether that QP would come knocking on their door 4 months later, when they get to the case.

     My concept was to make it uniform in density, such that you can't "see" it on an xray - so it doesn't look like baggies, just another uniform volume of space.

     Just wanted to chime in on the signature topic. I always waive the signature when shipping express, but seen  packages had been signed more than a couple of times when checking tracking. Here's where it becomes tricky. What if these customers didn't sign? Fuck knows whether that QP would come knocking on their door 4 months later, when they get to the case.

    War implies two sides that both fight each other. It is not fair to ourselves to say that there is a drug war, because nobody is storming the homes of the evil federal agents and police or killing them in various ways. What is fucked up in the drug holocaust, the drug massacre. A drug war would be much better than what we have now, because then our enemies would be suffering just as much as these poor innocent kids are going to. The police and customs agents responsible for this need to be hunted down and sniped from the roof tops.

    I agree... But if somebody orders 100g of MDMA to a house where the rest of the stash is kept that's just plain stupidity... Karma has nothing to do with it... I drive fast a lot, but when I have loaded trunk I set my cruise control to 4 miles over and don't hope for divine intervention when I get pulled over driving 85...

          Just wanted to chime in on the signature topic. I always waive the signature when shipping express, but seen  packages had been signed more than a couple of times when checking tracking. Here's where it becomes tricky. What if these customers didn't sign? Fuck knows whether that QP would come knocking on their door 4 months later, when they get to the case.

     The biggest risk is definitely to the receiver of the package. However, it is up to the vendor to mitigate that risk with proper packaging and stealth, something which the seriousness of is not often enough stressed to vendors, nor are they held accountable enough imo by buyers when they get a sloppy, risky package. Buyers also need to be smart and realize that just because you can have five different parcels of drugs delivered to your door every week doesnt make it a good idea. However with all the temptation and unexpected pop-ups of deals it is hard not to over do it sometimes.

    Dipset,
    <br/>
    after reading many replies on this thread i found yours to be the most soul searching for buyers (like Me). I really wish more vendors would use MBB's and give a minimum 2 wash prior to seal and ship, but at the end of the day this is still drug dealing. corners will be cut and those that will pay the price will be the buyers. there is no way to ensure the vendor you choose to do business with will abide by his/ her own rules or even industry standards, yes this is an industry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Try finding a domestic (US) vendor who uses great stealth and MBB's for M1 in medium quantities. They dont exist that ive found. I will never discuss stealth methods by vendors but the level of professionalism from existing US vendors needs to come up substantially.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to your point of over buying, this is so tempting. once pandoras box is open its tough to stop, especially for collectors. this is why multiple drops and staggered ordering is so important.

    Ok the way i see it is this.
    <br/>
    it was stupid to order it to their own house, Especially with their stashes in their own dorm. It was probably stupid to sign for it HOWEVER we all know quite a few vendors who would require a signature without a doubt for a package that large, who sends 100G mdma without escrow? you would have to be one hell of a trusted buyer anyway. so we dont know if they were stupid signing for it, if it was part of their T&amp;C's they could have thought it was normal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only way i can see round this is so...
    <br/>
    1) Order it and pay a little extra to your vendor and explicitly state you want it broken down and sent in smaller amounts. (extra cash for extra packaging)
    <br/>
    2) Get it sent to a drop address where somebody else will sign for it if it needs to be done. Make sure they know what they are recieving so that if they do get controlled delivered they dont freak out and say "i had no idea honestly XXXX just asked me to sign for it" however even if they know what's in it, half these assholes would try and rat you out anyway. (hard time proving it though if you keep your PC clean)
    <br/>
    3)always keep your wits about you and use common sense, just because your last 3 weed orders arrived does not mean you can order 100G of MDMA in one package to your own door. SIMPLE.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    people seriously need to start using MBB's as standard, your customers security and freedom is not worth the risk!
    <br/>
    Know i assume that Le know the majority of materials used for stealth. So we have to assume that they have ordered a few in the past just to research how it all works. if this is the case then all we can hope is that vendors stay one step ahead, Not only that but that the police cannot just simply open every package going through every mail depot because we make our stealth blend in as much as possible.
    <br/>

    am i correct ? have i missed anything?

    War on drugs can be won by Silk Road. If we spread the word rather than the drugs.
    <br/>
    These kids had rich parents anyway, they shouldnt choose drug dealing for a job.
    <br/>
    And with so many customers they had, i bet someone talked about them on LE..then a name/address is enough for a LE to give alarm for flagged address at postal service and stop/search anything that goes towards it, knowingly of SR's existence...
    <br/>
    Try not be a drug dealer, but even if you have to, then have 1-2 persons that buy your stash, at good price so they can have some profit too, and everyone is happy. selling directly from SR to end user is a much more profitable thing, but very very dangerous. SR is a paradise for drug USERS. No need for big risks.. But i understand someone poor trying to make some money out of SR..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    SR is about trust. If you know your vendor, then no need to sign for anything. they chose the signed-tracking  as shipping method, instead of normal mail, only to be sure they wont get scammed (cause of FE). They didnt trust enough the vendor..........................everything would be ok with normal letter, NEVER SIGN EVEN if ITS A MILLION worth product INSIDE. NEVER. its the first rule we learn as noobs here, isnt it..?

    I have my doubts whether signing makes any difference.  Obviously if the package was not supposed to require a signature and someone shows up asking for one, that's one thing.  But not signing for a package that you know was supposed to require a signature???
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've said it in other threads, but who on earth refuses delivery of a package unless it doesn't have your name on it?  I doubt any normal (non-SR) person would tell the mailman to go pound sand if he showed up at their door with a package with their name on it.  They would think they forgot they ordered something, or maybe it's a gift, who knows.  But telling the mailman to GTFO with a package with your name on it raises huge red flags and to me is evidence of knowledge of guilt (if we're assuming it's already a controlled delivery and they're just trying to get more evidence on you).

     I have my doubts whether signing makes any difference.  Obviously if the package was not supposed to require a signature and someone shows up asking for one, that's one thing.  But not signing for a package that you know was supposed to require a signature???
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I've said it in other threads, but who on earth refuses delivery of a package unless it doesn't have your name on it?  I doubt any normal (non-SR) person would tell the mailman to go pound sand if he showed up at their door with a package with their name on it.  They would think they forgot they ordered something, or maybe it's a gift, who knows.  But telling the mailman to GTFO with a package with your name on it raises huge red flags and to me is evidence of knowledge of guilt (if we're assuming it's already a controlled delivery and they're just trying to get more evidence on you).

    Denying a package that requires a signature wouldn't raise red flags in my opinion.  USPS encourages people to refuse any packages that they did not order, and if you simply deny ordering anything and say you weren't expecting anything there's nothing they can really do except ask you some questions.  They can't prosecute you for not accepting a package that you don't know the contents of.  You shouldn't sign ANYTHING without knowing exactly what it is you're signing for as a general rule, not just packages.  Denying a package doesn't show evidence of guilt in a court of law in any way.

    And that's why you should always study something with the vendor for orders of that magnitude. Just as a single example:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Don't receive all the amount on a single drop (especially if the drop is yours and even more especially if it's a frat house, how dumb can you be, seriously?) but divide them and let the vendor ship, for example, 5 packages with 20g each at different drop addresses, NOT linked to you (the people receiving them should neither know who you are and act through a middleman).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2) If one of the drops get caught it will be much easier to keep out of jail him/her with 20g than with 100g, and if the guy knows s/he will be out of jail s/he will have no point on snitching anything, actually knowing that doing so (because they should be informed of all of this previously) would remove from them that possibility altogether (cops don't help).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, just thinking for a second about the thing instead of pretending that you will be perfectly fine buying 100g and signing for a package yourself on a frat house with bunk already in would not be so much to ask, isn't it? I think that if one really wants to work on this field s/he should be prepared and have an operation going with all things planned before, and NOT improvised, ffs.

      At this point, I think just sealing the product isn't enough; you're still fundamentally shipping the product. I'd suggest technical solutions, make the package look like something else.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Example, a toy remote control car, one of those off-road ones with big knobby tires that you can pull off. Carefully foil/vac sealed, you could fit 100g of powder inside those tires, and have it be smell-proof. Custom's isn't going to rip apart every toy checking its nooks and crannies for drugs, and properly disguised, it could even be invisible to xray.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disguise edibles as a care package from mom, with a note and some boxers inside. We're considering detection avoidance from a technical standpoint - what are the technologies they're attacking with, and how can we thwart them, but you have to consider the human whose job it is to sort through these. - we have to blend them in.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Figure out what is sent through the mail most, then evaluate it for potential disguises. 3/4 of a deodorant stick could be hash, with a usable amount of deodorant at the top.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My only problem would be that upon receiving them, I'd first use the deodorant and drive around the toy car to amuse myself knowing it's rolling around a couple thou. of drugs inside.

     i see what you're saying, but none of that is really plausible
     <br/>
     <br/>
     a vendor would have to have a ton of toy cars/deodorant sticks/whatever to do this.. driving up product costs and not to mention how LONG it would take a vendor to do this.. if you were just saying for the large orders then i could see it. but even still it would slow down processing times for all orders big time..
     <br/>
     <br/>
     some weed vendors can't even keep up with orders as it is now.. throw in something like that and it would take them a week to ship an order..
     <br/>
     <br/>
     too bad for those dudes. sounds like they were pretty careless and i can guarantee they told anybody who would listen that they get drugs in the mail. what i found odd is that they were just charged with intent to distribute and possession and such.. nothing related to getting the molly through the mail in the first place.

    It depends on the size of your operation whether it is plausible or not. When you think about it, your freedom is priceless. A vendor can take the time off necessary to manage time or manage more people, find out what devices/products they want to ship in, learn what the time/value ratio is from disassembling, stuffing, reassembling and shipping. Once that is done, especially if you are shipping a product that has sufficient margins, it's worth it.

    Correct me if I'm wrong, but these poor buggers were having their international (and likely the Netherlands, given the contents) orders mailed to a FRAT HOUSE at a notorious party school in New Orleans. I don't care how great the vendor's stealth was: given the combination of return and receiving addresses alone they might as well have asked him to scribble ☼~♡ PLUR ☆ LIFE ♡~☼ on the envelope.  Customs agents (unlike Kappa Sigma pledges, it seems) are not retarded.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moral of the story: don't ship to known fraternities (or anywhere else where you're storing additional quantities of drugs).  In the meantime let's just hope their parents can afford good lawyers.

    It's the same. Just because you are in the bulk game you should take in consideration the dangers in it and plan accordingly. In this case the counter-measures to prevent customs to destroy your life if just a single package is intercepted are the same as destroying your life if someone snitch on you on the drugs you are receiving at your home with your name in (in very short terms: don't fucking order a 100g package all at once in your damn frat house with bulk drugs already in there, divide the shipment and use clean anonymous drop houses not tied to you in any way).

    I read both the thread and the news articles, and couldn't find anything about informants. If someone had snitched I'd think it would have been a local controlled buy, not a CD involving Customs.

    People living near college campuses get all sorts of international mail - it's very common. Many people travel internationally, take semesters overseas, get jobs teaching English in other countries, then send packages to friends at school.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's really a shame that they were caught and are charged with all that. I've noticed that many posters are being very critical of the students and all of the mistakes that they've made. But honestly, who hasn't made serious mistakes in their youth? The big difference is that these kids didn't have a chance to learn from it and move on - they will be dealing with the repercussions of this for the rest of their lives. Sure, it's easy to say to "only use drop addresses with absolutely no illegal drugs or residents who use drugs", "only have one package mailed at a time", "never have drugs in your residence", "only purchase exactly what you need at that moment", "never tell anyone that you have or will have drugs"... But seriously, who abides by every single rule, all the time? Not many people who are seriously into their drugs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can think of quite a few times where myself or friends have gotten in close run-ins with the law. Times when someone has gotten pulled over or temporarily detained but the officer did not get permission to search a vehicle with all sorts of narcotics, notice the open beverages in the vehicle, didn't realize we were under the influence of psychedelics, etc. Those are petty examples, but it's pretty common for people to slip by with something minor when much more nefarious deeds are afoot. They had a nice little assortment of drugs on them, but the quantity or variety doesn't seem all that excessive. The difference is that they got caught with all of it and are now getting fucked. That could have been a lot of us here - minus the whole frat house, carefree miscreant youth thing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Like others have mentioned, I'd guess that word got around about their plans. Having lived in similar places (esp where you're living in close confines, shared rooms, communal areas), everyone generally knows what's up.

    What you say makes sense if you are a normal buyer not buying in bulk amounts, but if you are going to buy 100g MDMA or similar bulk amounts then sure as hell YOU MUST be perfectly aware of what you are doing and have everything prepared early, just because - as you said - your life can be ruined, forever. Ignorance is never considered as an excuse, and if for your own ignorance and carelessness you go into trouble that's your fault.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sure, everybody does mistakes here and there, but the more the repercussion of a possible mistake is high the more you should be on the attentive side of not letting a mistake to happen to begin with. Depending on what you do you can be more or less relaxed on the approach. Ordering bulk amounts has NOT the same leeway of ordering personal amounts, but this everybody should know perfectly before ordering bulk, isn't it? I mean, it doesn't certainly take a genius to understand.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously, I ask you: if you were to order 100g MDMA yourself would you consider the thing as you do with a normal personal amount order? Would you think that you can behave with the leeway and carelessness that you can in the latter case? No, isn't it? So all your "it's easy to say, everybody commits errors" is an idiocy because we are not talking here about some inevitable errors that can always happen but of errors that could be easily overcome by simply not being careless and lazy and thinking about what you are going to do and the responsibility of the act.

    It doesn't matter if you sign for a package. Once customs intercepts a package they have enough cause to investigate the recipient, that means they have access to your phone history/txt messages, internet history they can open your mail, follow you, and search your home. Simply signing/receiving a drug package to your home isn't going to hold in court.

    We still DO NOT KNOW that it was bought and distributed using Silk Road.  I read nowhere in that news-post that SR was even mentioned.  More than likely it was not used at all.  Any respectable, reliable vendor on SR would NEVER sell that much, even if they were veteran purchasers.

     We still DO NOT KNOW that it was bought and distributed using Silk Road.  I read nowhere in that news-post that SR was even mentioned.  More than likely it was not used at all.  Any respectable, reliable vendor on SR would NEVER sell that much, even if they were veteran purchasers.

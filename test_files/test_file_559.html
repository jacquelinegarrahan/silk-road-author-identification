    It depends what type of dog. In Italy they use pigs to find and smell shrooms under the ground (truffles), so I can't imagine it's that hard to train dogs, although I doubt general drugs dogs are trained for this due the fact it's simply not worth it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order to train a dog to sniff something you have to get the dog addicted to that drug, and shrooms aren't that common and must all smell different so I doubt there's dogs that can sniff a particular genus of shroom.

    In the USA, passive dogs (those used in mail sorting centers) aren't trained to smell MDMA.

    Weed, coke and meth is correct.

    Ok, I am going to go out on a limb here. You can not train a dog to sniff shrooms (Defined as Ps. Cubensis, Tampanensis, or Mexicana). I spent 4 months trying to teach my lab to sniff them out. Thought it mite be an easy way to find wild's growing around my area. When he got the idea, it was any mushroom. The upside was I found Honey Mushrooms, Puffballs, Boletes, and several others.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As to truffles, have you ever smelled a fresh truffle? They have a pungent odor and can be smelled while out on the counter. It is very distinctive and easy to spot. The reason Pigs are used is they naturally love them and hunt them. They don't train them to find the truffles they use pigs that go after them on instinct.

    Most of what you said is correct, but they do have to train pigs to go after truffles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Pigs don't have some built in bit of their DNA to go after smelly truffles, pigs will eat almost anything. They need to be trained, otherwise it isn't economically worth it.

    Most of what I have read about truffle pigs has said that they take a group of piglets out and let them do there thing. The ones that naturally go for truffles are selected to be used. Although Wikipedia does say they are trained. Many sites state that they are trained to not eat them and they have a natural love for them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, I have no experience with pigs hunting truffles.

    Right. Im aware of pigs and truffles. And Im sorry I should have been more specific. Im speaking Domestic U.S.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I know edibles are shipped around on the regular, so I would imagine that it would be hard to actually train anything to know the difference between all the kinds of shrooms out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I appreciate the rapid and awesome responses everyone

    This is simply not true. You just get the dog to think his tennis ball or whatever smells a certain odor.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also I know they use pigs to smell out truffles never heard of dogs doing this (however i don't doubt it).

    Actually dogs are preferred to pigs for truffle sniffing because they don't try to eat the truffles.  Anyone who thinks dogs can't be trained to smell fungi is a more than a little delusional ...

    Was it an international order? Assuming even the lamest attempt was made to conceal a whopping 1/4 gram; I would say you're fine.

    Well, you have to ask yourself; How likely was a 0.25g of coke to be detected? Smell would be almost non existent. Unless it was literally just a ball of coke stuffed into a plain envelope, detection would be highly unlikely. It will probably show. If it doesn't, I doubt it's due to detection by LE.

    yea i dont think the LE(whatever that stands for) would be called for .25g its a silly amount,but what about the postal service?if they found it would they jus throw it out and leave it at that,or would they keep an eye on my mail jus incase more comes?

    LE= Law Enforcement. Perhaps the postal workers could have trashed it, but in my opinion your package will show up. It's an extremely small amount of drugs.

    Glad your order finally made it, should say though I think you are underestimating the power of canine detection, unless the vendor takes careful precautions to package anything in a clean environment i.e. away from where drugs are kept and/or handled and ensure they was their hands after handling the drugs before packaging it is entirely possible trace residue will be transferred and smell detected, even for such a small amount.

    Alright got myself in a little situation and hoping you experienced brainiacs can help me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We ordered a few packages before to our business address, but with the previous tenant's company name on the package. We still get mail of his 4 years later and it seemed like the perfect idea. And it worked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We now got a little testy, ordered 6 packages at once from 6 vendors and none of them have shown up (tomorrow will be a week, and they're all priority/express shipments). We had a vendor track and he said the tracking shows it went out for delivery and then was "UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED". The vendor explained that this is because we didn't put ATTN: Name we just put the company name (which mind you, it's worked before, so we're not complete idiots).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a friend who would be willing to go to the local post office to try and pick them up... a quick Google shows that people have successfully picked up packages before with that error. The only problem I forsee is proving that this random business is ours. I was thinking of potentially making a fake business card with the person's actual name on it and the name of the business the packages were sent to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does anyone have experience doing this? What do you recommend? In total it's about $4,000 in SMALL packages and all from very legit vendors with excellent ratings. Two of the vendors have assured me that even upon opening the packages no one would know what it is (which is surprising to me too).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    HELP! And thank you!

    How are you ment to know which product is whos and finalize accordingly?
    <br/>
    Now you are going to fuck around the vendors by delaying their payment due to your stupidity. This in turn could effect other users if the vendor gets fed up and enforces a FE rule.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you cant use basic common sense, you probably shouldnt be using SR. Since you will probably end up in prison.

    Meant to use the word risky.... the first "tests" worked fine and we gave it 2 months to cool off and see what happens. We ordered small amounts from different vendors and they'll all different products and distinguishable. I have been scammed for $3000 last week from EJDirect and I have the utmost respect for the vendors. I have no problem FE'ing early (or on time) I am just looking for a resolution. We were dumb and now we are in a pickle.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I expected your response and I expect most people will say "drop it" but I am trying to prevent these packages from being returned to a bunk return address and being opened by god-knows-who and bringing more attention to an underground operation. If I can successfully intercept the packages then I can learn from my mistakes and move on.

    If the packages were only marked as undeliverable and not seized, then you should be able to retrieve the packages without much hassle. If you are concerned regarding the old business and can do it quickly, a bogus business card wouldn't hurt (but may be overkill - don't go and make 500... ;) ).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For me, personally, I would be a little sketched out by going BUT if there is no suspicion of illegal things in the packages, then they should just hand them over. And if a friend is willing to go, then you should be okay. $4000 of product is a lot to lose. If the post office asks for an explanation (unlikely), you could say you changed your business name a while back but some packages still come as the old name. They won't know that it was previously owned by someone else. For all they care, it was just a mixup.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Obviously, like you said, I wouldn't use that old business name anymore for deliveries if all six packages were undeliverable. If you currently have your own business and receive legit packages anyway, any SR packages should be able to blend in to the normal traffic.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Either way, good luck! If the vendors' stealth is as good as they claim, you should have no problems.

    For me personally I would go down as a member of the current company,
    <br/>
    I would ask for the packages under the old business name,
    <br/>
    I would show my own ID and the card, or the tracking number, some proff that you know they are there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would not send someone who does not work for the company down with a fake card as this is more doggy.
    <br/>
    If you go down there and you work for the buissiness you could at least say that the company names sometimes
    <br/>
    get mixed up, and have a resonible story for paluasible dineablity, however if you dont work for either company,
    <br/>
    and your prentending to work for one, and they are unlikely to be on to you, well your really going to have to think
    <br/>
    of something to explain that..
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Im not sure if this helps but its just my thoughts

    I think USPS will immediately return to sender if the package isn't deliverable as addressed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just curious: how certain are you that your friend won't give up your name if he gets questioned by the police?  The police are really good at freaking people out and getting them to talk.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, $4k is small change compared to bail bond and a good lawyer, not to mention doing time and having a felony on your record when you get out years later.  It is easy to get ahead of yourself on SR and order too much at once.  Sucks but you really should just let this go.  Kind of a shame since you were ordering domestic.

    As crazy as it sounds... we went today and got one of them. They didn't have any other packages. Wondering if we just got lucky and the others were sent back and this one was just about to be and we caught it? They said if we give them tracking #s they can tell us where they are exactly, but we didn't have any. We messaged all of our vendors to get the tracking #s to hopefully grab the rest of them. Thanks everyone-- lesson learned.

    Glad you got one thou.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Have you asked venders if they left a return address?
    <br/>
    If not would USPS potentially open the package?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they are going to be sent back, why bother going back
    <br/>
    to see where about in the process that is?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They will either get them back or wont, no matter if you check.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People seem to forget how serious and how much you need to think
    <br/>
    everything through on SR they get carried away and think they can get away with
    <br/>
    things... The police are fuckers, they are not your friends, they will fuck you over
    <br/>
    if you give them chances like this...
    <br/>

    Freedom is very precious.

    Did the delivery issue occur on a Saturday?  USPS will sometimes just not bother to try to delivery to businesses on Saturdays and make up some bullshit excuse.

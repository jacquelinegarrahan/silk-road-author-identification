    It depends but usually nothing will happen. You'll get a little warning letter and if you do I suggest you stop ordering internationally. Domestic is a lot safer. Canada has some pretty tough border inspection.

    They basically just tell you not to do it again, as it's a criminal offence and you can be prosecuted.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the one I seen they had something like, "if you were not expecting to receive said substance and you have any information about where it came from, please contact us on 0800-customs-are-cunts-221"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Unless you're getting a very large amount, don't worry too much.

    Funny thing I've been on the road for over a year and have had 98% of my shipments international and domestic many countries show up perfect (To in the states). But one time I get a love letter and it says the seized 4 G's of K to my address under the name I normally use. I never order that though so I was very confused. The letter with different check box's 1 said to either like take it to court to fight to get it back, the next said to send it back claiming it wasn't yours n they can seize it and you had no knowledge of the contents, and the last was to not reply at all it would be seized within 30 days and destroyed. I don't know if this happens a lot or it was a SR fuck up but I have never had any other problems and I have made plenty order before I received and and after I received it.

    Out of all the years I have been ordering illegal items online...I've only ever received 1 "love letter." A lot of times customs won't even bother sending you a letter now.

    Customs will only send out a love letter if the drug is of a certain class or below. Anything above that class will be referred directly to LE.

    Benzos etc. = Love Letter

    Good stuff = LE 'investigation'

    A month after they intercepted my package I received a letter. So considering the fact that vendors are as slow as shit, it could take anywhere from 1-2 months for you to receive the LL.

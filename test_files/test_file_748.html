    I've discovered the absolute best way to ship LSD without any risk of it getting discoverd. Thank me later.
    <br/>
    Given the fact that LSD comes on blotter paper, one does not even need to use the postal service. LSD is also active on regular paper.
    <br/>
    Recently I've received an entire sheet of LSD, withing 5 minutes of ordering it.... by FAX.
    <br/>
    I know some of you will think faxing things are methods of the past, but please look into it because faxing sheets of LSD is fast, safe and secure.
    <br/>
    I should win an award for coming up with this new ingenious way of shipping LSD.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Peace.

    Isn't fax paper shiny and not very absorbent though? That could be a problem as blotter absorbs a lot more. Maybe you could get around it by enlarging the blotter when you scan it, maybe enlarge one hit to about 4" square then you should get the same amount of LSD on it.

    2 types of faxes: Laser printing faxes and thermal faxes. Will ignore inkjet faxes as they're just not cost effective enough to be commonplace.

    Incidently, The first use of BPA was to enhance the growth of cattle and poultry. The second use of BPA in the mid 1930s was as an estrogen replacement for women.

    Might have BPA to thank for the bitch tits -_-

    When you fax a piece of paper, it transmits the information on the paper, not the piece of paper itself.
    <br/>

    HOLY SHIT. You are joking right? I cannot even detect sarcasm on this forum anymore after some of the shit I have read.

    Nope, sorry mate but you clearly have no idea how a fax machine works.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Inside it compresses the actual piece of paper which you want to send until it is tiny, then it forces it down the telephone wires with electromagnetic propulsion. The piece of paper which comes out at the sending end is actually a copy of the original, which is sent to the receiver.
    <br/>

    Please at least TRY to read up on things before you post.

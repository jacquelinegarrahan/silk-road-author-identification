    So, thinking that the risk was close to nothing as the person on the other end is very trusted and my address was not on the letter, i agreed to send a friend some MDMA. Real return address(not mine though), and used mylar, but the packaging could probably have been better had i realized the risks involved on my end(the other party was fully aware of every step).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The fingerprints. The mother fucking fingerprints. My prints are on file with my government as i was arrested as a youth for possession, but not the government who is receiving the letter. I am 100% completely freaking out, did not sleep last night and have felt sick all morning.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So seeing as i don't want to mention or talk to anybody i know about this for security reasons, am asking here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What are the chances that, if intercepted, they:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Care enough to do anything about a gram of pure MDMA
    <br/>
    2) Would investigate the sender before the receiver
    <br/>
    3) Fingerprint the letter
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they do care enough, whats the next step?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) Receiver first? or sender first?
    <br/>
    2) do they print the letter?
    <br/>
    3) would the US have access to my print even though I'm not in the US?
    <br/>
    4) would they care enough to ask for access too/already have access too other countries fingerprint databases?

    You addressed it correctly to him, and the return address is a real address, that is the most important things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If customs caught it, they would destroy it, I doubt they would do an investigation over one gram of MDMA. Investigations cost a lot of money!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask your friend to let you know when he receives so that you can relax.
    <br/>

    Good luck.

    Firstly why do you think it has been seized? Do you have written proof?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the country you're sending to seized it then there is very slim chance they will contact the authorities of the country it was sent from. And it's a gram like you said. Chill dude you're fine.

    I dont think it was seized, but there is a decent chance it will be. Two things worry me that didn't occur to me:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1) It was packaged in a place that has lots of MJ coming in and out every day and often smells of it.
    <br/>
    2)Although mylar was used, if you feel the letter you CAN feel a little bump in the middle. Slight, but it is there.

    Chill man, it's just a gram. Even if they find it, nobody gives a fuck. Your return adress will probably get a letter from the customs and thats it.
    <br/>
    Governments have problems getting information of foreigeners in cases of murder and other major crime, they won't care about a gram of Molly sent through mail.

    Oh, it's Canada? You're probably fine, from what I understand, customs isn't too tough from there. Plus, I've read it's hard to get a good fingerprint anyway. You'll be fine, but it might the be longest 8-9 days of your life. I'm assuming you sent it "unregistered mail"?

    You are fine. It costs too much money to take fingerprints from a package of 1 gram of mdma. It already costs too much to test it to confirm that it is a controlled substance.

    I hear ya...I just placed my first(small) order from up that way a little less than two weeks ago. First couple days I felt safe....started reading more on the forums, kind of got paranoid. Even thought the feds were outside my house at like 5am because I kept hearing car doors and other random noise. I scoped it out, ended up just being the wind blowing on something causing it to sound like a car door or other noises at my place. I relaxed, read the forums more and felt better again. Started getting nervous because it was taking longer than I wanted to wait(just because I was nervous), but I just made sure I had a clean house for a few days and it showed up without incident. Most of the time for small amounts, they just give you a letter saying something was found. You'll be fine!

    you will be completely fine.  I've had a friend send 15 tabs from Colombia to the US in a book with a fake return address and the name spelled wrong on the envelope (long before i started researching this stuff, pretty stupid).  Anyway, customs opened the package, opened up the book, put the tabs in a different page than my friend sent, and sent it.  Needless to say, we both had heart attacks for about 2-3 weeks on end.  Nothing ever came or happened, so i'm pretty sure that you will be fine with yours, especially since your address is not on it. Fingerprints are mostly only used in extremely serious situations, other than that customs might as well dispose of the package and send you both letters instead of paying the fees to have tests done on the envelope that in sum will cost more money and time than it is worth.

    So it actually ended up making it and something weird is going on i think. I sent down SuperTrips extremely high quality mdma from a batch i have had for quite awhile. I got a message saying they railed .2(i flipped when he said that, i cant handle .12's) and that not one of them felt anything but a little awake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So thinking that they must be getting something other than MDMA, i ask how their rolls go and they say usually last about 45 mins. What?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So i suggested buying a regeant test, but any ideas as to what is happening? i put my word on the quality of this, and i know for a fact it is amazing(have done it lots myself, and so have a good 100+ people around here, all with 100% amazing feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I saw a picture of the letter and it had a stamp on the front with some letters, i assumed this was normal. Any ideas?

    Are they very experienced users? Are you sure they are measuring it out correctly? I can't imagine very many people knowingly setting up .2 in a line. No idea if it's true or not, but I remember hearing something about you needing to already have a roll going to be able to snort it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When they say it lasts 45 mins, does that mean the peak lasts 45 mins or the entire roll experience lasts for 45 mins? They did something wrong, I'm sure. Either it was a bad weight, they split the .2 like 4 different ways(below therapeutic levels), or they might be on SSRIs? What would happen with your package? Customs opened it and replaced it with methylone? lol

    I wouldn't be too worried. Government agencies have budgets, and they have to allocate funds where they can get the most bang for their buck . Like most govt or businesses, they don't have as much money as they need/want so they aint wasting it on small time shit.

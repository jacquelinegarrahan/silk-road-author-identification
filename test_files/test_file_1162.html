    Hey,
    <br/>
    has anyone ever experienced something negative when a package got seized by the customs? I lost a few MDMA packages and weed packages this month and now I am wondering if the customs are working with a pattern (such as contriving after the looks of packages or the receivers name).
    <br/>
    Thanks in advance

    That sounds very scary. Did u keep sending packages to the same address and name etc? If yes there is a good chance the address is flagged somehow.

    Were they shipped all around in the same time?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And how big were the orders?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you didn't ship them all to the same address, if they really all didn't arrive you better be on your toes bro.

    I have shipped spore syringes all over the world. The one place that confiscated them was Germany! Even though the stealth was good and they looked exactly like a legitimate product with supporting paperwork, the German customs grabbed them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One person said he got a letter from German customs and wanted to know how my stealth worked. After explaining it to him he went down to the customs office to get the package. They told him that they would not release it because they could not identify the liquid. He pointed to the included paperwork in the package, and their response was "Sorry we can not id the contents, although the paperwork states what it is we can not be 100% sure and as such we can not release it to you."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, if you are in Germany... I feel sorry for you, seems the fuhrer and his gestapo live on.

    Alright, they were all shipped to the same address sadly. Yet over a longer period of time and it was only a small percentage which got seized. It was around 100g weed, 50g mdma and 5g coke which got seized but that is only about 20% of what was sent. The weed got seized over a period of a week, but it was from the same vendor. The MDMA came from the Netherlands which is generally risky and got seized over the period of half a year and the coke came from the UK and got seized all at once.
    <br/>
    Yet I got no letters of the customs, just the tracking numbers which show that the item never arrived in Germany, but was sent from the destination country.
    <br/>
    Not sure about the flagging since a lot came through and I never had any issues with the police or so.
    <br/>
    Thanks for the suggestive replies so far!

    Either a postal worker found out what was in that package and decided to steal it or you got very lucky after they found it they just decided to let it go to not go through tons of paper work...I'm just assuming.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    However, the seized orders aren't anything considered small.

    The thing is, two mates of mine are receiving orders in the same amounts and they lost several packages as well and they never got a custom letter aswell. I am wondering if it is even possible in germany.

    They claim that here in the states you are innocent until proven guilty, but in many cases it is quite the opposite.  They throw you in jail, send you to court and you have to prove that you are innocent.  Circumstantial evidence goes a long way in the states.  For example, you sign for a package of drugs but haven't even opened it yet but you automatically get arrested and have to fight to prove your innocence.

    That is different here. How the heck am i supposed to know whats in the package. Because i sign it doesnt mean i ordered it. In germany the judges are cool. They go strictly by the law and if police takes people to court without hard evidence u can see the police getting slapped by the judge(seen first hand haha). They claimed some of us had a grey cap when infact the only cap there were was mine and it was blue (the only cap i had anyway). Lawyer asked police why THE FUCK they didnt make photos from the persons in that night and to better bring more evidence next time haha. They brang 3 witnesses whom all told a different story, also confirming the grey cap, which lead the judge to only one possible judgement: guiltless.

    I'm searching for a good weed vendor.
    <br/>
    So as German you don't have to assume that you will get busted with your first seizured order?
    <br/>
    I was searching all the time for a good domestic bulk weed vendor, but if the only thing I have to fear is the loss of the package I'll just look that my orders stay in the EU.
    <br/>
    I'm going to buy between 200-500g weed and I think I'll either order from NL or maybe Spain, if 1 package wouldn't arrive I would totally stop ordering non-domestic bulk,
    <br/>
    so do you guys think that there is a relatively low risk to get busted?

    Hey man,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    you could google "post eu kontrollen", maybe add "drogen" and "zoll" to that search and you will find plenty of information.
    <br/>
    There is even discussion on a jura forum about that topic, and many more websites...

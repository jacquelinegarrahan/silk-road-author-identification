    i use a made up business name.  i told the guy at the mailbox rental place that its my amazon seller name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i definitely don't want any of these dealers knowing my real name, nor do I want a package of contraband to have my real name printed on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it just adds another layer of obscurity to the whole process

    If I were to order drugs on here I would randomly call someone one out of the phone book, explain that the guy I ordered some stuff from on e-bay screwed up my address and it is coming to there address with my name. Polity tell them that if they return it to sender it will take another week and a half to get my item and it is my daughters birthday present and I really need it to be here for her birthday. Then ask them if they would be so kind as to call me on my cell when it arrives and Ill stop by to pick it up. Give them a number to a $9 disposable phone and wait.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When they call, dress like any other working dad and stop by to get it. Thank then and be on my way.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or maybe I would put in a forwarding address for a name on some random address, then order it to that address and let the post office forward it to an address of my choosing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could use a fake ID to get a non-post office PO box and have it sent there, or maybe any combination of the above.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A little creativity with the knowledge of how the system works and you can game the system. Let the FED's reading the board think on that one for a while.

    Awesome idea to incriminate yourself...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What the fuck you think a dealer will do with your name? I can get as many valid name and addresses i want... They won't bother coming at your houses for some bucks ....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be stupid and give your real name, you can avoid problems later if the cops find you!

    I use a fake name as I don't want vendors knowing my real name. I also have items shipped to where I live. I don't want to mess around with a P.O. box and have an easy sting set up. Where I live it'll be quite hard for any LE to set up a sting without me noticing activity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've had 100% success with all packages except those that come from the Netherlands, I only have a 50% success with them, and I think it's due to that country's customs.

    Shipping is done to midwest USA.

    Maybe he's afraid the keep nagging him on his facebook page:
    <br/>
    "Dude, how is the weed? Please finalize!"
    <br/>
    "Hey, I got some fresh haze, you prolly wanna check out my offers!"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Seriously, I think one should not be concerned with vendors having one's address, since the have so many of them, and if they wanted to harm you (e.g. blackmail), they would only raise suspicions against themselves. Furthermore, it is very unlikely that they live in the same area as you do. If that was the case, what would they do, break in and get their drugs back? Steal something else? Unlikely.

    Does anyone have some good info on this?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My question boils down to what kind of stuff they can sniff out...I know dogs can't sniff valium for example...but can these electrons things?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What countries are using these?
    <br/>

    Any serious help appreciated.

    It's not a sniffer, it's a scan. They can detect everything but the false positive rate is still quite high.

    I don't think so. unless you clean the outside of package properly. which is a lot of work to do.
    <br/>
    The apparatus can dedtect 1/1million gram. so the answer is pretty much NO.

    OK no offense guys but someone with actual long time experience shipping over borders needs to correct this. There may be sniffer that sniff for explosives but NOT drugs. How do I know this? I have been mailing many, many types of substances over the Canada/USA border (into the USA) for over 10 years. I have shipped kilos of hash,weed,coke,heroin and MUCH, MUCH more drugs that don't smell as bad and never ONCE has one of my packs been intercepted.  If you know how to safely stealthy package it is easy to get things through....If they had electronic sniffers that could sniff out drugs you could vacuum seal it 10 times and the sniffer would still pick it up, so it is fairly obvious that THERE ARE NO ELECTRONIC SNIFFERS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR DRUGS, MAYBE EXPLOSIVES BUT NOT DRUGS! :)

    Thanks for clearing this up! I could totally see people reading this and start freaking out about it, then making everyone even more paranoid. Need more experienced players like you to clear more "rumors" like this up more often

    I searched for somewhere the episode was watchable online and couldn't find anything, however the season can be torrented here:
    <br/>
    http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4980038/Cops_Season_21_HDTV
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Basically a domestic package sent via UPS with 2 pounds of weed is intercepted and the cops setup a controlled delivery. An undercover agent pretending to be someone from the neighborhood walks up to the house holding the package, claiming that it was accidentally delivered to him. He asks the guy standing on the front porch if he wants the package and he says 'Yea I need that package' and offers to pay $40 to the guy as a thank you. The undercover doing the delivery passes him the package (he isn't asked to sign or anything), and then immediately grabs his arm and slams him to the ground.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cops run in from everywhere and search the guys house and then question him. He denies knowing anything about the package, and the name on the package doesn't belong to anyone at the house. They open the package to reveal 2 pounds of weed sewn inside a pillow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They then start interrogating him aggressively saying he's going down for the weed while he keeps denying any knowledge of it, until they threaten to arrest his girlfriend instead (the owner of the house) and he finally admits it's his and they arrest him and take him away.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before the scene ends they show the wristband he was wearing that says 'winners don't do drugs' and have a laugh about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lessons learned from this:
    <br/>
    1. Don't trust anyone who isn't the mailman delivering a package to your house. Let the order go it isn't worth your freedom.
    <br/>
    2. Don't say anything dumb like 'Yea I need that package', if you absolutely take a package say something like 'Look I wasn't expecting anything it could be a mistake but I guess I'll take it if it's addressed to my house'.
    <br/>
    3. Don't stand around on your porch waiting for a delivery.
    <br/>
    4. Don't crack under pressure and admit any knowledge of the package to police, even if they threaten to arrest your girlfriend. Cops do this kind of shit all the time, just make sure your girl has no idea what you do so she can't be a liability to your freedom.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If anyone has a link to watch it online or a download link for the episode by itself please post it!

    A pillow? Really? I'm curious as to what the train of thought was behind that stellar idea. I swear EVERY story I hear about somebody being clipped is due to their own negligence. It always either ignorance towards the laws, mishandling the shipping aspect (fake names, shipping in PILLOWS, etc), or getting busted selling the product AFTER the fact (which brings em back to the house, scales, suppies, cutting agents (assholes), yadda yadda).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Moral of the story: People only get caught who want to get caught. If they didn't want to get caught they would take the many simple precautions to keep everyone involved safe (yes, even his girlfriend)  ::)

    I have lost lots of GF's because I would not tell them about everything. They want to be part of your life and do not like it when you cut them out of any of it.

    I couldn't agree more. I've always found myself attracted to extroverted, confident and intelligent girls and they seem to be extremely curious and inquisitive about what I get up to and where my money comes from. They know it's something naughty but I never tell them any details. Unfortunately they often go from being attracted by my secretive lifestyle to angry and resentful that I never share that part of my life with them even once we have developed a closer relationship. Very few girls understand that we do it because it keeps them safe if shit goes sour and we are facing a long time in prison. Someone told me once and it always stuck with me: 'If you don't know the secret, you can't be accused of sharing it.'

    The DEA program which ran on SPIKE TV for a season, has some good tactical info as well. I remember watching the Feds drop the ball on a coke controlled buy. The target ends up getting sketched out while pulling up, floors his range rover and does a u-turn completely evading the cops..Completely hysterical episode. The police generally only show you the cases which are successful.There was another episode relating to this thread, whereby some Jamaican guy was sending 10 pd weed packages to his hairdresser girlfriend.The cops held his GF and charged her after she couldn't get him to come claim the package. His spider senses must have been working that day because he got away...moral of the story is to trust your intuition and don't be an idiot when operating...

    All those talking about hiding shit from your girlfriends are idiots.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you deal drugs IRL, you should NOT have a girlfriend AT ALL.
    <br/>
    Have a few one night stands or whatever, but do not go committing to anyone.
    <br/>
    Its just too much trouble trying to shuffle the two. And lots of uncomfortable questions get asked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Safety first. Even if it means No Girlfriend, or No Sex, or whatever.

    I kind of think the "misdelivered to neighbour" idea is semi-clever, except if it's somebody I've never seen before it's going to immediately make me suspicious. A regular neighbour, no problem, but my regular neighbours aren't LE.

    Ordering weight is like climbing Everest. Yeah, you can just "let the package go" like you can let the summit go if the weather starts to look iffy, but the more at risk, the more tempted you are to take the chance. I'm glad I don't put myself in those situations. :)

    No.  That is exactly what happens during a controlled delivery.

    Uh, sure, and the most reliable method of birth control is abstinence. "Don't do it" isn't reasonable advice for drugs, for sex, or for relationships. People are gonna be people.

    It's fascinating getting a glimpse into the procedures of LE through these shows. It also is a reminder that it is important to deal with reputable vendors with stealth techniques that go above and beyond what one would expect.

    Thing I don't though is if this guy HADN'T been a complete idiot and admitted to shit, what would the cops have done?  I live with a couple different people and I don't always know when they buy something off the internet.  I'm smart enough to not have any gear delivered to my flat but if one of my mates did and I signed for it could the cops arrest me?  I don't know wtf is in the package and how could they prove that I paid for it or asked for it to be sent to me?  I feel like just accepting a random package whether it's addressed to you or not is a pretty flimsy case for the LEO.

     The DEA program which ran on SPIKE TV for a season, has some good tactical info as well. I remember watching the Feds drop the ball on a coke controlled buy. The target ends up getting sketched out while pulling up, floors his range rover and does a u-turn completely evading the cops..Completely hysterical episode. The police generally only show you the cases which are successful.

    This couldn't have been avoided. The cops said that they had a tip off from an informant, which means the vendor was a cop or one of his friends snitched. He could have done everything by the book but he still would have got caught. He didn't even sign for it, so I think the cops knew they wouldn't be able to prove it in court which is why the upped the pressure on him for a confession.

    So, I placed an order from Belgium with Express Shipping and Tracking. The guy who was supposed to be at the location to receive the package was not home when the delivery was attempted and they left a note. When I checked the tracking, it shows that the delivery was attempted, but the addressee was not home to accept. Then the next status update said "Handed Over To Customs". I feel like I should assume that this is not normal and the package has been seized. Am I right? Or do international packages get sent back to DHL customs or something like that after a delivery has been attempted? What do I do?! Please help SR community!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. The order was sent in two separate packages with two different tracking numbers and both tracking updates showed that "Handed over to Customs" status after the unsuccessful delivery status. What are the odds that both would be seized/discovered after an attempted delivery. What do I do??

    It should go to customs before not after.

    Are you definitely reading it right?

    I dont know why they're search a package AFTER they tried to deliver it.. weird.

    They can open everything without a warrant and while they are not the police they will call them to scrutinize suspicious packages.

    I definitely read it right. It said it was "Handed over to customs" after the delivery was attempted, which I also thought was strange. Why would they discover it after it had already cleared customs? Anyway, I also believe that it was seized...

    The vendor shipped it from bpost out of Belgium and I guess that DHL handles it once it reaches the US.

    It doesn't matter that DHL is delivering it, US Customs can open any package that they may think is suspicious cuz they are part of homeland security and do not need a warrant. I recently had a package sent from DHL as well from Belgium (bpost) but all was fine and I received my shit.

    I wouldn't def consider it burnt mate, weird it was handed over after clearing customs unless it was returned to the DHL facility and then was detected by a dog or something, I know DHL facilities have search operations conducted every few days by customs in AU, bloody unlucky if that's what happened.

    Hey guys, just want to let you know that the packages were redelivered without a problem today, so that "handed over to customs" status update was just a peculiar status I guess. The tracking updated to "Item in delivery phase" today and was delivered successfully. Lesson here, don't automatically panic when you receive sketchy tracking updates lol

    I'm with samebutdifferent on this. If it was seized by customs then the last thing they would do is put that on your form. Packages seized by customs appear normal or disappear.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I imagine that it probably just went back to the sorting facility and is sitting there

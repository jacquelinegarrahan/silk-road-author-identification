    I will be staying in a hotel for the next month. I asked and they told me I could have a package sent there.
    <br/>
    My question is, if I have a package sent from the Netherlands to the United States, to a hotel, will it be flagged or go under more scrutiny then it alread would?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Similarly, if I get a hotel room with a fake ID, which I have done before, but I don't stay there. And I have it shipped to this room would it be better and would this not be bullet proof.
    <br/>
    Because the item won't be put in the post office as the hotel will sign for it, and if they try to busy in the room, there won't be anyone there. I would just go by the room and pick it up later than check out immediately.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What do you guys think? It's worth it to pay for a room because this is going to be one huge package

    Getting shipments from yourself/your home country at hotels near the time when you arrive is common due to Air travel weight limits. You might call the hotel from the Netherlands to see if there is any issue with sending some heavy stuff by post. And, use a fake ID showing you live there. Maybe even get a shuttle ride from the airport "when you hit town" to the hotel if the hotel has that service. Be sure a plane from your "home country" just arrived recently. I would avoid the cheapest hotels. If you call ahead, you might want to have someone send a legit package as well from the same home country so you can say - "that was the package I was asking about over the phone". Might be good to have 2 people arrive at the room with both of them expecting a package? So you can stay there and and say that "other guy" or my "new gf" or... was the person who that is addressed to. I have not opened it, but they have been away and I don't know what happened to them (Have a story about this other person ready that covers where you met and why you don't know how to reach them).
    <br/>
    Maybe just this mysterious other person is the only one that needs to be from the Netherlands. Someone would act as them the day they checked into the hotel. Maybe do something memorable in front of hotel staff. Then not be seen much, if at all. That way you need not have a fake identity that could get you in trouble. You have been staying with him/her in the hotel since they arrived in town but have not seen them the last few days...

    I really disagree with everyone. In the shitty hotel I'm going to use, I don't think the staff is going to think about it to much. I was just saying will the package get flagged, or more of a chance of getting flagged because it is going to a hotel.

    I told you. if nobody has any reason to think that it will get flagged,  then it will not be flagged.

    You might be able to use the Hotel's address without the "Hotel" word? Maybe if you know the room# :
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your Name
    <br/>
    Street Address  #xxx
    <br/>
    City...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Or something like:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your Name
    <br/>
    c/o H. Johnston
    <br/>
    Street Address  #xxx

    50/50 chance? No shit. The pack either gets there, or it doesn't.

    So i have been ordering off the road over a year not both domestic and overseas, but i seem to have ran into a problem of late. I am now zero for four on orders from the UK to US, they just dont arrive, no notice, nothing. The strange thing is that i had this issue twice with one vendor and both times he offered a reship, and i had it shipped to a very trustworthy friend and both arrived.....so i tried a different vendor, both the original and reship never showed (another UK vendor). It makes me think that my address is being watched by customs or something, now on another note, every single domestic order i have made has showed without a problem, almost sounds to me like customs is intercepting all my international shipments and building a case, i dont know i could be over paranoid......any ideas?

    Sounds like you are flagged and if so i wuld clean shop just in case. I don't know how uk&gt;us customs work if they work together at all but i'd take precautions just in case someone shows up to question you or with a warrant either or..

    Ah I always hate seeing these kinds of topics. The paranoia sucks.
    <br/>
    I'm no expert but I would definitely NOT order anything else especially overseas. The worst I always heard on here was that you get the love letter. Actually no...the worst I heard was some guy on reddit saw his order/s weren't coming from overseas. He stopped. Then eventually got a note or something from LE saying they found a suspicious package to his address. He said he went in to the police station I suppose, nervous as fuck and stuttering  a little even. Simple denied denied and denied and he said they let him go no problems. I believe they asked like for his bank account info too or something like that. At the end of the day he got of no problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, thats why I'd never order from overseas. I always put it this way...customs can legally and very easily open your package to inspect therefore they will.
    <br/>
    I don't want to get you scared by any means but this is all that I heard.
    <br/>
    Best thing to do either way is be silent from what I understand...
    <br/>
    And I'd either use/sell anything you have in your possession just to be safe. If it were me I'd just chill on a little stash of personal bud and have nothing else.
    <br/>
    Oh and also! I always say this to myself "If they could get you, they would get you". In other words, if they have a strong enough case your ass would be in the police station already. If you aren't under arrest then they obviously haven't built up a valid case. They could say anything even "we know your using silk road, and bitcoins, we even know your account name and addresses you've shipped to. All on record"
    <br/>
    Ok well if that was true you'd be in trouble already. Always ask "am I under arrest? can I go?"
    <br/>
    Lets just hope none of this happens though.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck and keep us updated.
    <br/>
    My heart/prayers/thoughts are with you!

    well as long as it wasnt distribution amounts like an OZ or 2 OZ or more, they probably wont get a warrant or anything but it doesnt hurt to be on the safe side.
    <br/>
    Its possible the UK post office intercepted his packages before they left the UK which means they are flagging the senders packages and trying to catch HIM.

    my friend wasnt able to pickup three packages from the post office containing over an oz of ketamine and over a thousand pills due to getting incarcerated for something unrelated and going to prison before picking them up. nothing ever happened from that situation and hes since been released and received 2 international orders and had 2 seized by customs.  this was in the US.

    I have a 50g mdma order that has been missing for about a month. I'm pretty much in the same boat. I stopped ordering overseas. And cleaned out my house. All I can do is wait. But then again in these situations you don't even know whether or not the vendor even sent it. For all you know you got selective scammed. Also, it could be a USPS issue. The other day I received my neighbors mail. Stupid right? And I've already asked my neighbors if they received my stuff by mistake. No win. I personally hate USPS and selective scammers.

    BossNab- I've received neighbor's mail twice lately as well, one time it was crazy sleep meds he needed as a ptsd vet lol.

    I think it'd be smart not to have a reship but rather a refund?

    Just my opinion but you shouldn't be ordering international if your house isn't clean anyway.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That said, there is a huge difference between ordering 1g of ketamine and 100g.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not sure if you ordered from MarcelKetman or not but he and CloudSurfer are the two vendors I trust the most.

    i dont think i was selectively scammed, the first two orders the vendor did a 100% reship and i had it shipped to a friends house, both re-ships made it, without a problem, if i was being scammed they would not arrived on reship

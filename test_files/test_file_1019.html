    Mylar bags are only as good as the vendor who packages with an ultra clean process. Pretty easy to fuck the outside up if they are not careful.

    The most simple logical explanation is that the outside layers of the packaging were contaminated, I agree on the conclusion the community has forwarded.

    Be extra anal about packaging, use two gloves on each hand if you are using relatively low quality gloves. Also, package everything separately in different locations as to not contaminate any surface of the packaging other than the inside of the HDPE or BoPET (mylar).

    i definitely agree with this. any extra precaution taken on a vendors hands is a respectable one. as long as it's done right, the addition of mylar makes me feel mighty safe ordering.

    Seeing as I made it my personal crusade to get vendors to ditch PE food saver vac seal and start using MBB's then yeah I'd say it's worth it, if using one method over another with no discernible price differential can make your order dog proof then why not do it. I suspect those mylar bags stuffed full of weed were not wiped down properly or packed in a clean environment.

    Let's just hope the Breston's of this world with their super senses are few and far between.

    i do see this as to the the corner stone of doing it right, but realistically how many vendors can attest to abiding by such high standards?

    I imagine there was probably some kind of tip off that led to the bust.

    The fact that they've used Mylar bags to mask the smell of loads and loads of weed shows it atleast works for the human nose, which was what it was probably intended for at first.. until the tip off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If this was packaged in a clean environment (which I doubt, most likely packaged in a grow house) then I could imagine the dog would be flung off too.

    Also, Its ALWAYS good to literally wash the sealed package, w.e it may be, to try and get ri of as much transfer odors as possible.

    No such thing as overkill on packaging stealth. Yes alcohol wipes for small packs. I actually take LBs and wash the mylar in the tub, just to be sure.

    I ordered something from someone internationally, it's been 30 days and still hasn't arrived. I ordered from another seller with about a week turn around time, and it's been a week+, and during my 2nd order I had also ordered something else from another seller. None of this stuff has shown up. The only thing that showed up was a domestic shipment. How can I know if my packages have been seized? And what will they most likely do if my packages have been seized?? How long before people come knocking at my door?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the feds do come, one issue is that I live with my family and they obviously don't know about what I'm doing, and I'm never home until night time. Note, I am in the US. Any help would be appreciated.

    If your package has been seized, sometimes you will receive a customs love letter and sometimes you won't. Unless you made a huge order, I wouldn't worry about it...just stick with ordering domestic for awhile.

    So let me get this straight, you are new to SR? (assuming you are judging by your 3 post count), you have made multiple 20g orders from o/s to your families home address and they haven't shown and you are now worried?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Firstly, WTF are you doing making 20g orders from the outset!! you should start small, build up stats and knowledge then move up to larger orders with trusted vendors you have a relationship with to a drop not associated with you, using you families address is just not cool, how will your mum feel about a 4am door knock with a sledge hammer??  You may feel like I am being unduly harsh, if that is how you feel I make no apology, this is I am afraid what you need to hear!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are these orders in escrow or did you FE?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you FE'd due to your noobness then you could quite easily have been scammed more likely than your orders getting seized. Also multiple 20g orders IS A BIG DEAL and if I were you I would be making sure my computer was well and truly erased.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make no more orders, sort your shit out, do some research and come back in a months time armed with some knowledge of how to use SR more safely and keep yourself (and your family) out of the shit.

    I'm in a similar situation actually. Ordered two packages from the EU and the first one arrived in the standard time but the second one has been almost three weeks and I'm getting worried :\ but all of the vendor's feedback says that he has some of the best packaging on the road and that the chance of getting it seized is insanely low, but who the fuck knows.

    Thank you for your response. I appreciate your concern and warnings, but I've used SR many times in the past year. The reason I have almost no activity on the forum is because I registered solely to ask this question. I've made many orders before without issue is why I was starting to worry. Fortunately, today, all my subsequent orders showed up. Aside from my worry about the feds, I do follow proper SR form with picking trusted sellers, etc.

      Firstly, WTF are you doing making 20g orders from the outset!! you should start small, build up stats and knowledge then move up to larger orders with trusted vendors you have a relationship with to a drop not associated with you, using you families address is just not cool, how will your mum feel about a 4am door knock with a sledge hammer??  You may feel like I am being unduly harsh, if that is how you feel I make no apology, this is I am afraid what you need to hear!

      Are these orders in escrow or did you FE?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you FE'd due to your noobness then you could quite easily have been scammed more likely than your orders getting seized. Also multiple 20g orders IS A BIG DEAL and if I were you I would be making sure my computer was well and truly erased.

      Make no more orders, sort your shit out, do some research and come back in a months time armed with some knowledge of how to use SR more safely and keep yourself (and your family) out of the shit.

     Thank you for your response. I appreciate your concern and warnings, but I've used SR many times in the past year. The reason I have almost no activity on the forum is because I registered solely to ask this question. I've made many orders before without issue is why I was starting to worry. Fortunately, today, all my subsequent orders showed up. Aside from my worry about the feds, I do follow proper SR form with picking trusted sellers, etc.
